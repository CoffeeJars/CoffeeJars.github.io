<p class="title">Life Stuff and Motivational Fluff </p>    

<p> I have been reading and loving <i>The Power of Habits</i>. Great book. Inspiring and interesting and applicable all in one. When I finish I’ll be detailing my more complete thoughts. </p>

<p> A quick life update:</p> 

<p> The finish line is in sight. School ends in less than a month. I have an SAT retake looming. I’m still trying to squeeze every last drop of sour-time from life’s lemons. </p>

<p> Still plummeting towards 200lbs bodyweight. Still racing towards a 6-minute mile. Still reaching for my toes. A close squat grip in cahoots with excessive weekly pressing volume seem to have nibbled away at the edges of my elbow tendons. The inflexibility doesn’t help. Ice and band work seem to be reviving the joint. The pain is on the retreat. <br>
I have my first powerlifting meet in three months. </p>

<p> In my last update, I talked about focusing on four things. I lied. In reality I’ve been pouring myself into fitness, and academics, and not much else. My social life and free time have both suffered. This is okay. Life is about allocating resources. Perhaps a day will come when I will wish that I was more well-rounded during my freshman year of college. Perhaps not. </p>

<p> I just know that I have a goal in mind.<br> And if you aren’t chasing something, what are you doing? <br>
Don’t be content to let life pull you along. Don’t watch life go by episode after episode like some Netflix binge. Life isn’t great, but it has its moments, and they’re worth living. <br>
I don’t mean to sound like some bullshit motivational speaker when I say these things, but in a generation of aimlessness it might serve us well to pick up an instrument, book, ball, even a barbell. In an age where people are crippled with anxieties and distractions and social constructs larger than human evolutionary capacity, it might serve us well to chase something. It might serve us well to set our own course. </p>
