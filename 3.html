  <img src="nami.jpg" style="width: 100%;">
<p>My current approach to school work (and I guess by extension life itself) centers around the concept of diving headlong into each new challenge as it rises. Now that sounds dramatic, but It really just means a singular focus, to ‘undivide’ and conquer. </p>

<p>I don’t believe in multi-tasking, since it hasn’t worked for me in the past, and since the people who do multitask produce work which really does not inspire envy (to put it nicely). Instead I am opting to single-task, we aren’t computers, we can’t run programs on multiple threads, so why try and act like one? </p>

<p>In the context of my life this has meant that I am more goal oriented, more focused on one objective than some nebulous idea of study and improvement. For example: This week I have my third and final chemistry exam, a big deal, everyday my energy and prep is going towards this exam. Other subjects, math and computer science, will be on the back burner. I’m not ignoring them, just keeping them warm. </p>

<p>It’s like that famous painting of a tsunami (which turns out is not really a tsunami), I’ll be in my little boat and ride out each challenge as it comes before me and focus on that challenge alone, before turning to the next one. </p>

<p>I’m confident I’ll find some new structure for my life by the time finals comes around and this system completely crumbles. </p>
