<p>I went hiking today!<br>
In retrospect it was not my brightest idea to go for a rugged climb after a night of snowfall. Especially wearing Asics with soles like sea glass. Every trail was covered in a layer of compact snow. Luckily there were only a few close calls and a very wet pair of pants. Quinnipiac looked beautiful from the top of the blue trail. </p>

<p>I need to start pulling together a class schedule for next semester. It seems as if I will be confined to Connecticut for another year at least. More on this as it develops. </p>

<p>Later, in a booth at North Haven’s “Athena II” diner, I overheard the most interesting conversation between two men. It spanned halfway houses, schizophrenia, the pope, the possibilities for life after death, and the underground trade of supermarket coupons. I hope when I’m middle aged that I’ll be able to meet friends in dinners and have similar conversations. </p>

<p>In the PM I hit the gym. Still running the nsuns 5day routine (against my better judgment). Bench press felt fine. I added conventional curls after two sets of hammer curls. When doing T2 overhead press I rowed the weight for sets of 20. After 5 sets I felt my forearms give out. Pumped, stiff, with jittering fingers, it was great. </p>

<p> See you space cowboy...</p>
