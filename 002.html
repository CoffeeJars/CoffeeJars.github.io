<h2> Goals and Dreams </h2>



<div class="col1">


<p> First real post on my new blog, let’s go! <br>I’ll be outlining all my plans and goals and dreams as well as what steps I’m taking to reach them. </p>

<h3 id="subtopic1"> Transferring </h3>

<p> Starting with the most important goal: leaving Southern Connecticut State University far behind. </p>

<p> Faithful readers and friends will know (and be tired of hearing about) how badly that I want to transfer to the United States Naval Academy. </p>

<p> I don’t want to bash Southern too hard, It’s a great school, really. It’s just not <b>my</b> school. I don’t even think I want to try and transmute those feelings into words. Simply put, everything from the classes to the people to the food to the parking garages, leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth and a twist in my gut. </p>

<p> It’s not my school. </p>

<p> Transferring is tough. Especially to a school with single digit admissions and an application process comparable to one of those competitive TV shows. I’m determined to do everything I can to get in. </p>

<h3 id="subtopic2"> Grass is always greener </h3>

<p> I have always struggled with enjoying the present. Before I had my license all I could think about was driving, now I commute to work and wish fervently that I could bike.   </p>

<p> It’s one of those deep-down human condition things that we can never truly shake off. Personally, I just really need to focus on finding joy in the everyday. I can’t live my life looking for greener grass and trample the grass under my feet. </p>


<h3 id="subtopic3"> Blocking it out </h3>

<p> Sadness can manifest itself in many ways. It’s like those cough medicines which send some people into dreamland and act like cocaine on others (I myself fall into the latter category). </p>

<p> Similarly, when someone is sad they can react in the expected dreary-lethargic way, or they can become hyperactive, spam their Snapchat story with adventures, kick life into high gear, work a job, join a gym, smile and laugh a whole lot and generally be absolutely dead inside. </p>
<p> Something else I need to keep in mind is to be aware of this. In my own life and others. To take a breath. </p>


<h3 id="subtopic4"> Athletic training </h3>

<p><b>Powerlifting</b>: I have a meet in three weeks! I must admit I’m really nervous and really excited. I’ve been training 2-3 hours a day for 5 days a week for a couple months now. I’ve gotten a few dents and bruises here and there, but I’ve got the fire in my belly, I want to lift some goddamn weight. </p>

<p> I am aiming to total >1050lbs in my competition. </p>

<p><b>Rowing/Cycling</b>: My favorite forms of cardio. I’ve been doing lots of conditioning on the erg (rowing machine). Conditioning work is generally done in intervals. 1 minute on, 1 minute off (either resting or slow paced). This has made a huge difference in how I feel throughout the day. I feel like many lifters would do well to incorporate some cardio. I’ve always loved cycling, ever since my dad took me to the baseball diamond at my elementary school and taught me how to bike around the bases. When it got too dark that night to bike anymore, I went home covered in dust, with a new love. By practicing cycling and rowing, I help condition myself, and keep them as a backup in case I want to pursue a sport other than powerlifting (of which I have reservations) at the Naval Academy. </p>

<p> I am aiming for a 7minute 2k erg time. </p> 

<p><b>CFA</b>: The candidate fitness assessment is the physical test which counts as ~10% of admissions to the Naval Academy. After my Powerlifting meet I will be changing my focus to train for it specifically. More running, more push-ups and pull-ups and sit-ups. Boy they do love their –ups. </p>

<p> I have been working on a specific training program for the CFA, I’ll post it when I finish it. </p>

<p><b>Grip training</b>: I have been working sporadically to increase my grip strength. I want to be able to close the 1.5 CoC gripper, and do a 2 minute deadhang. </p>

<p> Other sports I have interest in trying/playing: boxing, soccer, tennis, wrestling, strongman, Olympic weightlifting. </p>

<h3> Job update </h3>

<p> Currently I am working for the State of Connecticut, in the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP). </p>
<p> Overall I really like my job. Good hours, good pay, I get to listen to audiobooks. The only downside is that the basement in which I work makes me pale, and sometimes after listening to audiobooks for 7+ hours I feel as if I am losing my mind. </p>

<p> When I head back to school I will have to reassess staying with the State, or returning to my cushy campus job. </p>


<h3 id="subtopic5"> Projects </h3>

<p> one of my (admittedly many) faults is that I love to start projects and hate to finish them. So many stories, essays, websites, workout routines, spreadsheets, Linux scripts, mods, texture packs, ROM hacks, have fallen prey to this. </p>

<p> I want to fix this. In my very limited free time I have been attempting to return to all these old projects and finish them. When I do, you can bet I’ll post them here. </p>

<h3 id="subtopic6"> Finances </h3>

<p> I’ll keep this short. Below is a list of financial goals I want to meet. </p>
<ul>
<li> $2,500 emergency fund (NAVYFED MMSA) </li>
<li> $2,500 stock portfolio (INDEXED) </li>
<li> Pay off my first year of college. </li>
<li> Stay on track with my budget (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XxVT3H1-l5yDF0fWPd3etC-cLzjJvyYFr2bW9f-ZRIc/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet here</a>)</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="subtopic7"> SAT </h3>
<p> I also plan on retaking the SAT. I’ll be studying with Khan Academy and aiming for a 1400-1500 score. This isn’t all that interesting so let’s move on. </p>


<h3 id="subtopic8"> Life is not a training montage </h3>

<p> I find that this is a really bad perspective that many people fall into. Those cheesy videos of boxers or athletes training, perfectly clipped together with orchestral music and motivational voice overs, that’s great and all, but it’s hollow. <p>
<p> Winners are not the ones who had the most motivation to do something, who listened to inspirational speakers and threw themselves into training. Winners are the ones who throw themselves into training without the motivation, on every single day even when they don’t feel like it. The people who get ahead are the ones who train when they feel awful, when they would rather be doing anything else. Motivation will not help you, motivation is fleeting. At the first sign of a cold, or an injury, or more interesting plans are mentioned, your motivation will abandon you. What you need is discipline, a habit, a way of life, which lends itself to progress. </p>

<p> At the end of the day: You are what you continually do, not who you continually want to be. </p>


<h3 id="subtopic9"> You are not a machine </h3>

<p> At the same time, you need to remember that you are not a machine. You have not been programmed to execute a set task to train for a sport or get ahead in life. </p>

<p> To be human is to be weak. You will have bad days, feel alone, feel sad, feel broken, be broken, all those fun and happy states of being. </p>

<p> Again this is just the human condition, I interact with a lot of people online who try to leave humanity behind in their quest to get better grades, be more productive at a job, lift some big weights, this is a mistake. Pushing aside friendships, family, personal time, hobbies, anything and everything to squeeze more productivity out of yourself life a goddamn juice box is a mistake. </p>

<p> Trust me. </p>
