<h2>Half Marathon</h2>

<p>A little bit too late, on the way to the race actually, I realize I’ve never run more than a mile in my life.</p>

<p>Only five minutes to go. The national anthem is played. We're all crowded up behind an inflatable arch with ‘start’ spelled across in sans-serif white. </p>

<p> My younger brother is wrapping the cords of his headphones around his ears. I’m thinking about the differences between girls who run long distance, and girls who powerlift. </p>

<p>There are many. </p>

<p>I only kept up with my brother for half a mile. He promised to stick with me, but I wave him forward, and let the dry-fit crowd swallow him up. </p>

<p>The sky, which has hung heavy and cerebral all day, finally breaks open and hurls showers towards the earth. My phone screen goes black and refuses to turn back on no matter how frantically I tap the screen or press the lock button. </p>

 <p>Running and powerlifting seem to exist on two ends of a spectrum. During my meet I was blank, a hinge, a structural support, I was a human distilled down into some simple machine. But as I plod through puddles and up hills, my mind is wandering, my legs are out of focus, moving sloppily beneath me, kicking up rain, I’ve dissociated completely. </p>

 <p> I'm thinking about all the fonts on all the sponsored shirts around me. I'm thinking about what this must look like from above, a rainbow snake slithering through an upscale suburban town, slowly coming apart as the group divides into smaller and smaller groups of runners. </p>

<p> There are more hills. I slip further back, further into the snake of the race, I feel it constricting my calves. </p>

<p>Figures loom out of the rain in colorful L.L Bean raincoats, shouting encouragement, offering cups of water. My brother has instructed me to sip, not gulp. I don't know why. The water makes me feel better. </p>
 
<p>Everyone runs with careful foot strikes, robotic, carrying out some programmed function, executing line after line of code, feeding themselves into the compiler of the race. I feel defective. </p>




<p>Back on the dissociative thought train. I’m thinking about how automation requires humanity to rethink purpose. We are designed to survive long enough to reproduce, but as we delegate every demand on our bodies to inanimate hardware, is there a meaning in existence without survival? There is something very human about a wounded gait. </p>    

 <p>My right calf has become a cement pillar, shoulder and side stab sporadically, my hamstrings feel like the end of a log being slowly lowered into a wood chipper. I am thinking frantically about all the types of injuries I could get. I'm hoping that when the injury comes, it's not serious, not a knee blowing out, not a hamstring pulling, not a piece of me falling out and bringing me crumbling to the ground like a Jenga tower. </p>

<p> I must be close. We’re running along a seawall that keeps an iron sea at bay. The race had started at a beach. I must be close. An ambulance idles on the side of the road, waiting for someone like me to keel over. </p>

<p> I really don’t know if I can make it. My legs are wobble on every footfall. I can’t bend at the knees anymore, so I’m forced into a limp-hop-trip-hobble type of choppy step. A woman runs by me, “Come on pork chop,” she says. </p>

<p>I see it. The inflatable arch. The finish line. <p>

<p>I cross it. </p>

<p> I finished in just over two hours. I know I know, very slow for a 19-year-old male, but I’m still proud regardless. <p>
