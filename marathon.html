        <h2>56th John & Jessie Kelley Half Marathon</h2>
        <p> I ran a half marathon. It was the first time I had ever run more than 1 mile. </p>

    <h3>History</h3>
        <p> I was a dreadful runner all the way up until my senior year of High School. As part of my NROTC application, I had to take a fitness test. A test which included a 1 mile run. </p>

        <p>I trained for it, but with none of the obsession that would later consume my powerlifting training. I ran a 6-minute mile, weighing 170lbs. <p>

        <p> Flash forward. It's been nearly two years. I’m in the midst of preparing to take a fitness test for my Naval Academy application. I'm a porky 208lbs, for the past year I've been powerlifting, lathering muscle and adipose onto my body, never running. </p>

        <p>My younger brother pushed me into registering for a half marathon. It was all very last minute, I actually submitted the online form only 11 hours before the race was slated to begin. I had not trained. I had not run in weeks. I was already tired from a week of full time work, not to mention my powerlifting training. </p> 

    <h3>Car Ride</h3>
        <p>The funny thing was, I wasn’t nervous. I knew I was hopeless; I knew I would probably be the least prepared person there. And yet, I thought of it all in a distant, almost intellectually curious way. I wasn’t nervous at all. </p>
        <p>It was an hour car ride to the white-washed and lofty-GDP bit of the Connecticut coast where the race was to be held. It was the kind of place where stock options and vintage automobile restoration where topics of conversation between strangers. </p> 
        <p> I felt good. My younger brother and I had split a sausage egg and cheese sandwich from a cafe I used to work at, and both sucked on iced coffees. The sky was grey and low and full of brainy swirls. </p>

    <h3> Before the Race</h3>
        <p>Everyone is so skinny. I kept looking around, searching for someone larger than me, so that I could feel more secure, less of an outlier in the data. </p>
        <p> The race had free physical therapists to help stretch runners. Mine asked if I played football, which I normally take as a compliment, but today I could only grimace at. </p>
        <p> My physical therapist stretcher lady, whose name I forget, informed me that I was very tight and that she had "no chance of getting me near my end ranges in a half hour."</p>
        <p>Only five minutes to go now. The national anthem is played. We're all lined up behind an inflatable arch. Spelled across the arch in sans-serif white is the word: start. </p>
<p> My younger brother is wrapping the cords of his headphones around his ears. I’m thinking about the differences between girls who run long distance, and girls who powerlift. </p>
<p>There are many. </p>

    <h3>The Race</h3>
        <p>My legs started hurting almost immediately. Great.</p>

        <p>I only kept up with my brother for half a mile. In transmission terms I was in 5th and he was in 1st. He has promised to stick with me, but I waved him forward, and let the dry-fit crowd swallow him up.</p>

<p>The grey sky, which had hung so grey and full, finally broke open and hurled rain down to earth. My phone got wet, and broke. </p>

        <p>Even without my phone I was listening to music. The drumming of rain, the bass drums of hundreds of pounding feet, my own uneven heart beat, vocals here and there, an old man who is bent nearly 90 degrees with age but runs with alacrity is saying, "you know I really expected GE to turn things around this quarter."</p> 

        <p>My mind is racing with me. Running is so different from powerlifting. During my meet I was blank, my entire being was focused on the lifts, during my half marathon my mind is always wandering, my legs are out of focus, just two stumps of meat that bombard my brain with pain signals, and move sloppily beneath me, kicking up rain.</p>
        <p> I'm thinking of how well equipped humans are for endurance running. I'm thinking about all the fonts on all the sponsored shirts around me, I'm thinking about the faces around me, so many expressions. I'm thinking about what this must look like from above, a rainbow snake slithering through an upscale suburban town, slowly coming apart as the group divides into smaller and smaller groups of runners, we're all out here alone, together. </p>
        <p>My legs are hurting very badly now. I'm thinking about how this marathon is a giant sequence of numbers, heart rates, ages, moment arms, blood pressure, vectors of directional force, just numbers crunching away. </p>
        <p> There are hills. Hills are worse. I slip further back, further back into the snake of the race, I feel it eating me, jaws constricting my calves. </p>
        <p>The course twists and twists and twists. I'm thinking about how this procession of runners has more dimensions than just length, everyone is taller and thinner at the front, and height decreases and width increases as we move down the procession. I am an outlier here too. I'm too tall for this 50th percentile splinter, and a feeling of being out of place comes over me with fresh rain and pain. I'm thinking how if I was better at math, I could graph this procession phenomenon. </p>       
        <p>Every now and then figures loom out of the rain in colorful L.L Bean raincoats, shouting encouragement, sometimes offering cups of water. My brother has instructed me to sip, not gulp. I don't know why, but I follow his advice. The water makes me feel better. I take a sip and pour the rest over my head, pointless since I'm already soaked to the bone. </p>       
        <p>I play a little game with myself, looking at the harrowed faces around me, and telling myself I can finish before them. I speed up and jump up a couple segments, but fall back before long, fall back further. It seems like no matter how hard you try; you'll fall back to the slot in the procession which belongs to you. </p> 
        <p>Miles go by. I tell myself that I can do this. I give myself mental pep talks, and intone "It's a mindset." But this is easier to do when you aren't soaked or exhausted. Both my feet are just pins and needles in my shoes. </p>    
        <p>I can't tell the time. The sky is drenched an impassive grey. The people around me run with careful foot strikes, like machines, carrying out some programmed function, executing line after line of code, feeding themselves into the complier of the race. I feel like a defective machine, my joints need oil, and my heart needs to be swapped out for a newer model. I'd be scrap as a machine.</p>    
        <p>I can tell that I’m getting tired because my thoughts are going down dark tunnels of pretentious thought and abstraction upon abstraction, tangents branch off like side streets, which the police have roped off, allowing us to run. </p>     
        <p>I'm still thinking about machines. How the body is a machine of sorts, how we as humans create machines to do jobs, how the purpose of our own body-machine was to survive long enough to reproduce, how we create better and better machines to do tasks with tremendous efficiency and render ourselves obsolete, the function of our bodies becoming more pointless by the day as we delegate to inanimate hardware. And yet in a world where we strive to do less, here is a procession of runners pushing themselves to do more. There is something very human about a wounded gait. </p>    
    <h3>The final mile</h3>
        <p> Things are looking awfully grim. My right calf has become a cement pillar, shoulder and side stab sporadically, my hamstrings feel like the end of a log being slowly lowered into a wood chipper. I am thinking frantically about all the types of injuries I could get. I'm spent. I'm running on the fumes of fumes of gas that I didn't know I had. I'm hoping that when the injury comes, it's not serious, not a knee blowing out, not a hamstring pulling, not a piece of me falling out and bringing me crumbling to the ground like a Jenga tower. </p>
        <p> I know I’m close. We’re running along a seawall that keeps an iron sea at bay. The race had started at a beach. I must be close. An ambulance idles on the side of the road, waiting for someone like me to keel over. </p>
        <p> I really don’t know if I can make it. My legs are almost giving out on every footfall. My stride has become a limp-hop-trip-hobble type of choppy step. A woman runs by me, turns back to me, and says: “Come on pork chop.” </p>
        <p>We turn another corner, and I see it. The inflatable arch, the finish line. <p>
