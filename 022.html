<p class="title">gym anniversary </p>    


<p> The last thing I could do right now is form coherent thoughts. But you, dear readers, should be used to that by now. </p>

<p> Today I switched gyms. My 1-year membership to Crunch Fitness expired. I guess it’s an anniversary of sorts. After a year: I’ve deadlifted 405, benched 275, and squatted 365. </p>

<p> My new gym is to crunch what the United States Army is to the Boy Scouts. </p>

<p> I went from a prince of the weight room, to the bottom of the barrel, a sardine in the Mariana trench. I’m also told what to lift, when, how much, all the details. I like that part. </p> 

<p> So today I was benching with T–, a guy who has three herniated discs, no surgery. Watching his face twist in agony on every rep didn’t feel too good in my stomach. He still lifted more than me though. </p>

<p> Long day. I ended up wandering the streets of Stratford, sore but too awake to sleep. It was dark except for pools of streetlight. I felt like a revenant, cursed to walk the pavement in search of rest. How poetic. Turns out I don’t sleep well in the heat. </p>
