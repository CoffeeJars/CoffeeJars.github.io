 <p> One thing that I love about writing these daily little blog posts is how it has gotten me writing again. I love coming back to my computer and seeing an open word doc with a half-finished post. </p>

<p> As part of my dantean trek to the Naval Academy I am going to start running with my younger brother. He runs both varsity track and cross country so I am sure that he will leave me in the dust. </p>
    
<p>I never finished writing this.</p>
