<h2> Fear & Failure  </h2>

<div class="col1">



 



<p> I got frustrated this week over my naval academy
application. <br>



The online form plays out like an ad-lib for secondary
school achievement: “My favorite varsity team was (blank), I was well liked and
my class’s (stu gov role), between practice and church service I serve my
community by (volunteer experience). </p>



<p> It’s not the fault of the application, or of the
academy. It does a great job of recognizing the effort and hard work that goes
into achievement. The reason it twists my stomach is because it pulls emphasis
away from my back-breaking (literally. See my powerlifting training) college
experience and focuses on my less-than-stellar High School performance. </p>



<p> See, I was your typical gifted but lazy High
Schooler (a laziness which did not extend to my full-time-part-time job washing
dishes). I had double digit absences per annum, slept through AP Bio, and got a
5 on my AP Language and Composition test without bothering to study. I remember
walking into school one day (late) to discover that the SAT was being given, I
borrowed a pencil, and landed in the 95th national percentile. I can
safely say that I graduated High School without ever conjugating ‘to study’
into the present or past tense. </p>



<h3 id="subtopic1"> Laziness and Fear
</h3>



<p> I don’t believe I was (or am) truly lazy. I
believe that laziness is just a symptom of something deeper. Laziness is the
visible tip of a much deeper iceberg. </p>



<p> I was afraid of failure. </p>



<p> Let’s put aside the obvious: of course a component
of the ‘lazy-but-gifted’ complex is the total lack of good habits to build
success upon. No organizational skill. No self-disciple. No intra or extra
motivation to accomplish school work. No study habits. No idea how
<i>to</i> study. Messy or nonexistent notetaking. Poor attendance.
Etc etc. This is all epidermal stuff. </p>



<p> When you’re young and gifted, you don’t fail, then
you grow older, you head off to middle school and you still can’t fail- but
things start to feel tougher, some days the answers aren’t in your head by the
time the teacher finishes talking, and now you’re in High School, and there’s a
possibility of failing. </p>



<p> I don’t mean like “fail the class” failing. No,
I’m talking about trying and failing. What if I put my head down, worked as
hard as I could on a project and it only got a 90. Is my best a 90? That’s a
frightening prospect. The paralyzing fear here is to pour your gifted self into
something, to try, to put effort in, to labor over something, only to find out
that you failed to do well. </p>



<p> It isn’t laziness. It’s just much easier to say:
“Oh yeah, that calc test? Got an 87. Never even studied though.” Than it is to
say: “That calc test? I was studying for weeks, but I only got a 94.”
</p>



<p> You are totally frozen. To melt and pour yourself
into something means risking disappointment. And so you hide in the shadow of
that numerical gap between your achievement and what your achievement could be
(the upper bound of which is unknown). </p> 



<p> This position means settling, rather than
striving. To be happy with less, because you know it is below you. You know
(and everyone else too) that if you tried harder you would do better, but trying
harder would reveal your real limit, and your fear of that limit keeps you
frozen. </p>







<p> It’s such a deceptively comfortable positon, like
the sweetness of the venus fly trap. 



 



<h3 id="subtopic2"> Simple Syntax
</h3>



<p> I’ve been doing a lot of introspection. It’s
probably because of the 2+ hour commutes I do daily, or the constant state of
brain anesthetic which comes with a tedious job. </p>



<p> I’ve come to realize that all those little
phrases, the ones spewed by school staff and repeated ad nauseam, have a lot
more meaning than you thought they did when you initially heard and ignored
them. Phrases that sound so stupid and shallow like: “Don’t be afraid to fail”
or “try your best”, actually can mean a lot. </p>



<p> The biggest irony is that a fear of failure has
led me to more failure than I could have ever predicted. But I’m done with it.
I’ll blowtorch every icy appendage, I’ll pour every cubic mL into my SAT
retake, into my fitness test, into my application, no holding back, no buts, no
escape clause. No fear. </p>



<p> I’m doing to find that upper bound. </p>
