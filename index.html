    <p><b>Kettlebells.</b> Powerlifting is out. kettlebells are in. Starting December 15th, I will begin the Simple & Sinister routine. Kettlebells, combined with some form of bodyweight training, will allow me to focus more attention on my studies, my job, and the world out there, the one outside the walls of a gym. </p>
    <p><b>Python and Calculus.</b> I have a huge backlog of python projects that I need to complete. I also will be tackling more project Euler questions using python. Finally I will be prepping for my spring calculus class.</p>
    <p><b>Reading.</b> I promised myself that before I buy anymore books I need to finish the ones I already have. I want to take advantage of my newfound time and crank some books out. </p>

    <i>And much more!</i>
