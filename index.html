<p>The spring semester has started.<br> Yikes, that sounds formal. I'm really not sure how tone works in a blog post, it's something which is probably going to take time to develop. The best blogs have a distinct tone, like those post-(post?)-modern books which are written in only dialogue and the reader must piece together who is talking at all times. As if reading books wasn't hard enough. Back to blogging. In a past life I used to lift weights and was an avid reader of the <a href="http://mythicalstrength.blogspot.com/">Mythical Strength</a> blog, that guy has tone. </p>
<p>I guess since I am getting back into fitness that I better start reading again? But I am getting ahead of myself. Sometimes when I talk its like a recursive call stack, I keep calling the talk() function repeatedly before the stack collapses. I used to be a computer science major, there look, I just did it again. </p>
<p>Speaking about tone, I think one reason why I have such trouble writing a blog post is because I have no idea who the reader is. In normal day-to-day conversations I adjust how I speak depending on who I am talking to. Some people don't want to hear about physics, so I (try to) shut up about it, some people are really into fitness so I dust off those dormant parts of my brain, some people are into art or architecture or music or- you get the idea. When I am writing a blog post, I can't adjust I just have to be me. </p>
<p>I went hiking for the first time at UConn. Here's a photo: </p>
<img src="fenton.jpg">
<p>I got pretty lost too. The <a href="http://www.ctforestry.uconn.edu/documents/fentonTRmap1_25_10JSv2.pdf">map</a> is wrong! A lot of the trails have been blazed different colors, and the sections marked unofficial trails have become official. I need to see if a more recent map has been posted anywhere before I hike again, otherwise I will have to make my own map. Which could be fun? I wasn't super worried about being lost because I knew that to the NE was the Fenton River, to the N was old turnpike road, to the S was Gurlyville Road, and to the W was UConn campus. I guess it's like numerical analysis (of which I know very little about), I didn't know where I was, but the error was bound by roads, rivers, and a campus. It was still a beautiful hike.</p>
<p>Let's collapse this talk() stack. Getting back into fitness. There was a time when I was really into powerlifting. A really interesting time when I was really unsure of what I was doing and what I wanted. I was pretty much the zero vector. I'm sure I will go back into that history in another post. Today we are looking forward. In the words of my old friend Grant: "...Health and performance are very separate goals and should not be confused." It's true. I used to be a lot stronger than I am now, but also a lot less healthy. This time my goals are different. I'm keeping it really simple: kettlebells, running, bodyweight. I don't like barbells anymore. </p>

<p> Enough meandering and rambling. I have to pick up a hoodie from the mail room and have dinner. You haven't studied until you study in a hoodie, hood up, strings pulled taught. There's a lot I didn't get to mention here, programming, physics, classes, research, emacs, meditation, stretching, reading, and all the rest. But Northwest is serving tikka masala so it will have to wait.</p>
