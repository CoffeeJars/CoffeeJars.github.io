            <p>=======================================</p>
            <p>I have a blog now. I mean again. Don't expect this to be well written, pretty, or insightful in the slightest. I think the expectations of such things has been a contributing factor in this blog remaining a stagnant and barren wasteland. 
            </p>
            <p>Speaking of barren, let's talk about this design. The inspiration here is drawn from a text file, with all of its limitations and ugliness. Font here is Courier, everything is done in a highly manual and difficult process. Perfect. 
            </p>
            <p>Oh yeah. I turned 20 yesterday. Crazy to think about. For now I need to focus on prepping for a Chemistry lab. </p>
