            <p>I have a blog now. I mean again. Don't expect this to be well written, pretty, or insightful in the slightest. I think the expectations of such things has been a contributing factor in this blog remaining a stagnant and barren wasteland. 
            </p>
            <p>Speaking of barren, let's talk about this design. The inspiration here is drawn from a text file, with all of its limitations and ugliness. Font here is Courier, everything is done in a highly manual and difficult process. Perfect.

            <p>Oh yeah. I turned 20 yesterday. Crazy to think about. For now I need to focus on prepping for a Chemistry lab. </p>

            <p>And so concludes the lab portion of General Chemistry II.</p>
            <p>My lab partner had this to say: "If anyone tells me avengers spoilers I'll mix ammonia with whatever other chemical makes the gas that kills us all."</p>
            <p>S01E02: The Naked Now<br>
Working through Star Trek TNG. Season one is a bit garbage but here we go.
Actually episode two serves a really specific purpose it seems. By making everyone 'drunk' and lowering inhibitions it allows for expedited character development. Exposing character motivations, relationships, and all that allows us to understand them and bond with them faster. It's actually a really good episode. It also manages to connect to the kirk era, something I'm sure older fans appreciated and had great suspense as a astroid hurtled towards the incapacitated ship. I like how the day was saved by conservation of momentum. That's cool.</p>
