to want is not to live, because to live in want, is not to live at all, he said, and <a href="lookabove.html">look above</a>, black spaces filled with plastic stars, hurtling down, down, down a hill at two am, tires whizzing the way they do, on asphalt that’s just a little wet, but no, slosh and slosh and slosh we go, bulbs   

hang and glow with light like spoiled squash, and now above, the sun is pouring down, cream ‘cross the horizon, light and sweet morning on your eyes, there’s coffee on your tongue, jerk awake, and topple out of bed, it seems my seams have split, get up he says, you’ve weeks to fill, and fill you will and fill you must, there’s knurling in your hands, so grit your teeth and brace and pull, he pauses, till your heart, the cheap balloons it is, goes splatter in your chest, you know you have a number, you’ve got eighty years at best, it’s tattooed across the vena cava, <a href="thebeatsyouvehad.html">the beats you’ve had</a>, the beats you will, there goes one, and another, slipping slipping gone forever, he leans in close, so now you know, <a href="the%20path%20ahead.html">the path ahead</a> is thick with swamps and seas, and you wouldn’t be the first, to get lost along the way, but think, how lucky that you are, to beat your life away.
