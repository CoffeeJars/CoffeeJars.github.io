<p>This is in no particular order. Most of it is out of date. All of it probably isn’t worth your time to read. </p>


<p>Week of 24 of 2018</p>

<p> Monday: <br> First 8 hour day of work. Checked out a lovely Café for my boss. Smashed my hand at the gym under a 45lbs plate. Miserable. Pain. Throbbing. Took a nice cocktail of melatonin and pain killers and then tossed and turned for the whole night. </p>

<p> Tuesday: <br> Miserable at work. Couldn’t bent my finger. Couldn’t focus. Slept terribly. Nearly passed out at the wheel while driving. Left work early and skipped the gym. Went to my volunteer position though with the fish and wildlife service. The mystery of KBT. Installed a camera. When I went home I had finally had enough. I asked my dad to help put me out of my misery and with a drill bit we made a hole in the middle of my nail and let the blood out. Instant relief. </p>

<p> Wednesday: <br> Another full day at work. Gym was really shitty though. No one really likes me there blah blah incessant whining on my part whatever. I need to try and bounce back and enjoy the enviorment. Doing rows on the deadlift bar was a cardinal sin apparently. </p>

<p> Thursday: <br> Work again. Rushed through the gym session. Everything felt tough. Still dialing in my deadlift form. Sometimes it feels really good and sometimes it doesn’t. oh well. I went to a graduation, that was fun, I also got buffalo wild wings, and died from the Mango Habenaro. Every time that I deadlift blood starts oozing from my finger like an active volcano. Grip strength still not there. </p>

<p> Friday: <br> Had coffee for like the second time this week and felt instantly better. I love harry potter, listening to the audiobooks in the morning is an amazing way to start the day. I was thinking about how much better of a book the second HP is vs the first one. The second one has HUMOR which is something that the first one sorely lacked. The first one has some lame tongue in cheek humor</p>

<p> Saturday: <br>
Ran around a bunch. Went thrift shopping and bought a hideously amazing sweater made from alpaca wool. Took a jaunt through a fancy Westport gardening store and wished that the Connecticut climate could grow coffee trees. </p>

<p> Sunday: <br>
Lazy day. Went to the local gym (not my hardcore powerlifting gym) and noticed the huge difference in environment. Messed around. Did snatches, rack pulls, silly stuff.  </p>


<p> I am happy to say that I have a new job. I was going crazy not working. I’m based in this beautiful Hartford office building, where I work in the records center. It’s a lot of filing, lots of alphabetizing, but I don’t mind. I’ve had worse jobs. Since my 16th birthday I have done construction, washed dishes, decorated cakes, delivered Chinese food, worked as a barista, and a teller, and even for my university. I’ve had a lot of jobs. </p>


<p> You might have noticed that the design of my blog has once again changed. I can safely say that this will be the final iteration. I want to take a minute to lay out some of my thoughts on blogging and design. </p>
<p> The obvious question, “why update a blog in the first place?” Well, it takes a certain kind of person. I don’t do it for money. I am under no delusions that enough of an audience would ever want to read my fragmented sentences, or keep up to date with my life, injuries, job, worries, training, reading, etc. </p>
<p>I blog because I enjoy it. </p>
<p> I love writing; I love making webpages. Blogging hits that perfect overlap in the Venn diagram. </p> 

<p> I wanted this website to be a safe haven, a shelter, a pirates’ cove for the written word. These days’ language has taken a back seat, hidden behind videos and pictures and audio and god knows what else. There is a quiet beauty in words. The mystery of language. Reading isn’t like watching a video, you don’t have information chewed up and spit back out for you. When you read you play the diver, in a reef of coral words, you play the archeologist dusting off sentences and phrases, labeling them carefully, subject verb article noun. Reading is hacking through a jungle, carving a path from intro to conclusion. </p>

<p> I wanted this to somehow be reflected on my site. To place the written word above all else. This is why my blog is text only. </p>


<p>I began working out to prepare first for NROTC and later for the USNA, both of which didn’t pan out. Despite this, fitness has become cemented down as a habit, and is likely to remain solidly in place until the day I die. </p>

    <p>Recently I have been finding it difficult balancing good workouts and my academic, student leadership, and work commitments. 5/3/1 is my solution. </p>

    <p>I feel like Jim Wendler’s program gets a bad rep for its deceptive lack of volume, or its use of a training max (using roughly 90-95% of your 1RM to calculate percentages). The truth is that both of these ‘flaws’ are actually great strengths. </p>

    <p>The program is skeletal, but keeps you in the gym, keeps you lifting, and importantly, keeps you feeling good. When you’re feeling good in the gym, the program gives you opportunities to push the intensity, with joker sets, or push the volume with first-set-last rep schemes.
</p>

<p>The same people that mock 5/3/1 are the ones who sing praises for brutal regimes like smolov, programs that work for specific purposes, but when incorrectly applied (as they so often are) lead to people breaking themselves down again and again under a bar, feeling beat up, pushing themselves so far deep into overtraining that the only light they see are the spots in front of their eyes after sets. </p>

<p>It depends on the lifter: some thrive under brutally repetitive and optimal programs, with high frequency and carefully tuned percentages that leave them forever hanging on the edge of their training ability, for others, a program like 5/3/1 provides the structure to get into the gym, and the opportunities to make it through bad days, and jack the weight up on good days. A program like 5/3/1 respects the lifter as a person, someone with a life outside of picking up things. </p>
<p>My current approach to school work (and I guess by extension life itself) centers around the concept of diving headlong into each new challenge as it rises. Now that sounds dramatic, but It really just means a singular focus, to ‘undivide’ and conquer. </p>

<p>I don’t believe in multi-tasking, since it hasn’t worked for me in the past, and since the people who do multitask produce work which really does not inspire envy (to put it nicely). Instead I am opting to single-task, we aren’t computers, we can’t run programs on multiple threads, so why try and act like one? </p>

<p>In the context of my life this has meant that I am more goal oriented, more focused on one objective than some nebulous idea of study and improvement. For example: This week I have my third and final chemistry exam, a big deal, everyday my energy and prep is going towards this exam. Other subjects, math and computer science, will be on the back burner. I’m not ignoring them, just keeping them warm. </p>

<p>It’s like that famous painting of a tsunami (which turns out is not really a tsunami), I’ll be in my little boat and ride out each challenge as it comes before me and focus on that challenge alone, before turning to the next one. </p>

<p>I’m confident I’ll find some new structure for my life by the time finals comes around and this system completely crumbles. </p>

<p>As part of my ongoing quest to increase productivity, I have decided to build a digital cabin in the woods. A hideout of sorts, a retreat from distractions, a castle high on the mountainside. I’m sure Ralph Waldo Emerson would be very proud. </p>

    <p>It’s really just a partition on my hard drive: a 32gb ext4 partition with Debian GNU/Linux. It has no X-server, no networking, just emacs. </p>

    <p>I created a 16gb fat32 partition as well, to serve as mutually accessible storage space. Whatever programs or stories or work that gets done in castle can be saved onto the bridge partition and accessed by OSX.</p>

    <p>The steps I followed to dual boot MacOS and Debian are summarized below:
      <ol>
	<li>Install MacOS</li>
	<li>Download and unzip rEFInd</li>
	<li>Create Linux, swap and storage partitions under OSX</li>
<li>Download .deb packages you want in the castle and save them to the storage partition</li>
	<li>Install Debian using the nonfree firmware iso (to get networking to work for the netinstall)</li>
	<li>Reboot & Reset NVRAM (Command + Option + P + R)</li>
	<li>Using the recovery mode terminal (So SIP is disabled) run the refind-install script</li>
	<li>Run dpkg-reconfigure console-setup (switch to a 32 font to accommodate the retina screen)</li>

</ol>

<p><b>The Goal- </b><br>Straight A's for the fall 2018 semester. </p>
  <p><b>Update 1- </b><br>Today is Friday, November 30th, 2018. I am writing this in the deserted third floor of the Buley Library. It is 3:57pm.</p>
  <p>The first step is to complete all my unfinished homework for the remainder of the term. With this out of the way, I can focus my sole attention on preparing for finals.</p>
  <p><b>The Aforementioned Unfinished Homework-</b>

      <li><del>CHE 120 - Lab Report</del></li>
    </ul>
  </p>


  <p><b>Update 2- </b><br>
    Today is Saturday, the first of December, 2018. It's exactly 8:30pm. I'm debating brewing a third cup of coffee, and my math homework remains unfinished. I'm running headfirst into the fact that much of what the homework asks (and surely the exam as well) has not been covered by my professor. Which is fine, but I'm going to have to adjust my plan of attack.</p>

 <p>I am going to read and take notes on the ~100 pages of chapter 10, try to distill it down. I need to regroup, refocus, come back fresh in an hour and power through the chapter tonight.  </p>

  <p><b>Update 3- </b><br>
    It's Sunday, December 2nd. It's 10:53am and I'm rattling along the rails to New Haven. I'm going to a bookstore/cafe. Thanks to my chemistry lab partner, progress has been made on the lab report front, as I'm still in a deadlock with mathematics. I did have a breakthrough in understanding how the sums of unlike trig functions can be rewritten as a single function through transformations. By setting the sum of unlike trig functions equal to the sum of angles formula, we create a system of nonlinear equations, where the transformations can be solved for algebraically.
  </p>


  <p><b>Update 4- </b><br>
    Well this is not going as I would have hoped. It's 8:37pm, coffee is going on right after I post this. Two more sections of math to go. I will detail below how to solve the trig system of equations. The one good thing is that I finished my reflection essay for INQ 391. Took me about 20 minutes to write three pages. </p>
  <p><b>Rewrite 3sin(x) + 6cos(x) in the form Asin(x+`phi`)</b></p>
  <p>   All we need to remember for this problem are two identities:
    <ol>
      <li>sin(`alpha + beta`) = `cos(alpha)sin(beta) + sin(alpha)cos(beta)`</li>
      <li>`cos^2(theta)+sin^2(theta)=1`</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>By setting the original equation equal to the sum identity, we get an equation that can be simplified:</p>
  <p>
    `3sin(x) + 6cos(x) =  Acos(phi)sin(beta) + Asin(phi)cos(beta)`

  </p>
  <p>
    Looking at the balanced equation, you can see that if it's balanced then:<br>
    `Acos(phi) = 3`<br>
    `Asin(phi) = 6`
    </p>
  <p>This is because on the left side of the equation sin(x) is being multiplied by 3, on the right sin(`beta`) is being multiplied by `Acos(phi)`. Therefore: `Acos(phi) = 3` and `Asin(phi) = 6`.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since we know the value of Asin(`phi`) and Acos(`phi`) we can use the second Pythagorean identity to solve for the value of A. </p>
  <p>
    `A(cos^2(phi) + sin^2(phi) = 1)`<br>
    `A^2cos^2(phi) + A^2sin^2(phi) = A^2`<br>
    `3^2 + 6^2 = A^2`<br>
    `A = 3sqrt(5)`

  </p>
  <p>
    Now we have everything we need to solve for `phi`.</p>
  <p>
    `3sqrt(5)cos(phi) = 3`<br>
    `cos(phi) = 3/(3sqrt(5))`<br>
    `phi = cos^-1 (1/sqrt(5))`
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally putting it all together!</p>
  <p>
    `3sqrt(5)sin(x + 63°)`
  </p>
  <p>PS: `phi` is only roughly 63 degrees...</p>


  <p><b>Update 5-</b><br>
Lab report is complete! It's 10:29pm. I'm going to read over chapter 6 of my Computer Science textbook for my quiz tomorrow and head to bed.</p>


  <p><b>Update 6- </b><br>
    Things might be looking up? It's 10pm, Monday December 3rd. I'm brewing coffee and about to attack the last section of math. I'm going to get two hours of hard studying in and head to bed around midnight.</p>
  <p>
    Tomorrow I have work as a math tutor at 8am - 9:30am. After work I plan on getting another hour or two of review done before my exam. </p>

  <p>
    With all this studying I should be fine. Should.
  </p>
  <p>
    In other news my chemistry lab is officially over. I finish with a 96% overall, which is a relief. Interesting fact: I wrote 10,188 words across my three lab reports.
    </p>


  <p><b>Update 7- </b><br>
    Finally. Online math work is completed. Too bad it's December 4th, and my test is in less than 2 hours.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm writing this in the math library, over a cup of coffee from the bagel wagon (since conn hall let me down again). I'm going to compile some questions and see my professor before the exam. Today is also my last day of INQ 391, after my exam I have to finish the portfolio. </p>
  <p>Wish me luck.</p>


  <p><b>Update 8- </b><br>
    It's 2:10pm, and I'm working the desk in the math department. </p>
  <p>
    Math test is over. I feel as though I did reasonably well. When I find the score out I'll post it here. </p>
  <p>With this math 'pre-exam' and my computer science quiz out of the way, the only thing that separates me from unrestricted finals prep is my INQ 391 portfolio.</p>

  <p>I feel as though I can finally take a breath and shift down a gear for today. Which is needed, I haven't properly slept in a few days, and it's getting to the point where my hands start twitching at odd intervals. </p>


  <p><b>Update 9- </b><br>
    It's 9:45am, December 5th and I'm using exclamation marks because its a good day! My pre-final math exam, is over. My homework for the semester is complete. I also wrote a little (messy) program to calculate my final chemistry grade. </p>

  <p>With all my work out of the way it's time to push the gas medal down and get started on these finals!</p>

<b> Thoughts on Harry Potter 1</b>



<div class="col1">

<p> The Harry Potter books were a constant companion for me throughout elementary school. I have a vivid memory of Mr. Tibor, my fifth grade teacher, hurling my copy of Prisoner of Azkaban out an upstairs window to get me to pay attention in class. 
I decided that this summer, heading into my sophomore year of college, I would reread the series. </p>

<p> So far I’ve chewed through the first three books, and come up with enough observations to catalogue some of them here. </p>

<p> There will be spoilers, but c’mon, </p>
<ol>
<li> It’s Harry Potter, everyone’s read it </li>
<li> It was released in 1997</li>
</ol>


<b> Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone </b>

<p> The idea that a downtrodden kid who sleeps under the stairs could escape his awful family life, make friends, and have adventures, is incredibly appealing to young readers. The whole experience is analogous to what we the reader do: escaping into the world of the books to befriend the characters, and go with them on adventures. </p> 

<p> The concept is appealing, but book one is terrible. Easily the worst of the series. Unquestionably bad. </p>

<p> The writing tries too damn hard and lacks the fluidity of later books, the plot stumbles and bumps forward like a goddamn freight train, characters are clunky and robotic, no humor, no chemistry. </p>

<p> One aspect of the book I do like is the subversion of the obvious bad guy trope. Harry is 11 in this book and his simplistic understanding of good and bad, where he leaps to the conclusion that Snape is clearly the antagonist, is a perfect reflection of his perspective and of the perspective of young readers. The villain just <b>has</b> to be that mean teacher who asks unreasonable questions, plays favorites, and takes points. But this isn’t the case. The true villain turns out to be the stuttering and unassuming defense professor. The fact that Harry (and you the reader) jump to the conclusion of Snape’s guilt, teaches a lesson about appearances and assumptions. </p>

<p> Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a necessary evil, It’s the awkward first date in what will become an amazing relationship. You drop the butter on the floor, spill water on yourself, your card gets declined, and you go in for a kiss after some garlicky oily linguine, but something about your stammered apologies and tomato-red face makes her laugh, and agree to a second date. </p>


<b> Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets </b>

<p> The second book is just hands down better. </p>

<p> I really love the start of the Chamber of Secrets, the uncomfortable realization that his friends haven’t made any attempt at communication, and the perpetual misery of the Dursley’s make for a great start. This does two things: First it once again makes us empathize with Harry, the characters which we invested ourselves in throughout the first book have abandoned not only Harry, but us too. This is something which JK does well, making the reader feel what Harry is feeling, which further connects us to him. Secondly, Harry’s annual return to the muggle world creates an excellent starting location for the books, and forms a dichotomy between the muggle and magical worlds. It grounds Hogwarts in reality, impressing upon readers that this takes place in <b>our</b> world, not some high fantasy realm with a polysyllabic name. By reminding readers of this, it builds more bridges between our lives and experiences and the contents of the book, drawing us in deeper. </p>

<p> This book also has <b>humor</b>, thank god! I am so happy that some editor probably held JK at gun point and told her to make her magic books funny. By adding in humor, the books become more fun to read, and a better reflection of the human experience. There are so many funny bits in book two, Lockhart’s lessons and idiocy, Ron’s ward and it’s many screw-ups, Colin Creevey and his incessant pestering, Wood and his Quidditch obsession. </p>

<p> The book also cuts some of the unfunny humor, some of the dumber Fred/George bits, and the stupid school song. </p>

<p> Even better than the humor, is the balance. The second book is noticeably darker than the first, attacks all over school, a student body who is afraid and resentful towards Harry, and yet this gloom is balanced out with the addition of humor. The book is a remarkable improvement over the first because paradoxically it managed to get darker and lighter simultaneously. The net effect of which is a book with more depth. </p> 

<p> This movement towards depth and complexity parallels the growth of both Harry and the reader. As I grew older and my emotional spectrum expanded, and the Harry Potter books widened right along with it. I think this is possibly the most important aspect of the series: Harry’s growth is as much a story about you the reader as it is about him. </p> 

<p> In terms of plot, a pattern begins to emerge which will remain constant throughout the entire series. </p>

<p> Dursley’s -> Hogwarts -> A problem -> The gang works to solve the problem -> Clues point to obvious bad guy -> Climax with dramatic plot twist -> train home and wrap up. </p>

<p> This is the structure of every single Harry Potter book. Book two is no exception. Every book has the classic bait and switch, where a character that the trio (and you) assumed was good turns out to be the antagonist. Quirrell, Ginny, Peter Pettigrew, etc etc. </p>

<p> Personally this did not detract from the series for me. The problems are diverse, and the world rich enough to make every year seem like a whole new experience. Many books that feature mysteries and plot twists are absolutely terrible re-reads, Harry Potter on the other hand is an amazing re-read. JK preserves this enjoyment by leaving all kinds of subtle hints and clues throughout the story, which were overshadowed in your initial reading, but which you will notice when returning. In book two this comes in the form of Ginny’s downward spiral, the Gryffindor culprit of the diary, Hagrid’s mention of Ginny being around the grounds (to strangle chickens) and on and on. These little hints don’t pop out on initial readings, and are actively shrouded from the reader (as seen in Ron’s insistence that Ginny is sad about the attack on Mrs. Norris because she is a cat lover, etc). </p>


<b> Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban </b>

<p> The books just keep getting better and better. Little by little JK has added meat and substance to the skeleton of book one, and in the third book, it staggers into life. </p>

<p> The third book makes <b>huge</b> strides in developing the characters. The third book is amazing because so much boils over, so much is developed, so much is learned about Harry and his friends. We see Hermione, the know-it-all and stellar student, crack under the pressure of her classes. We see the relationship between Ron and Hermione split along the seam of their differences in such real and organic ways. </p>

<p> To continue my analogy from before, the third book is that exciting relationship phase where you get to know someone. In the Prisoner of Azkaban, you really begin to get to know these characters, to meet them, not just to read about them. </p>

<p> I keep bringing it up, but Harry Potters biggest strength is in how it connects to the reader’s own life. We see a 13-year-old Harry and his angsty friends, with a world which is starting to expand outside of the school boundaries. I’ve read interpretations of other readers, arguing that the dementors in book three represent the characters falling into a depression, so typical for hormonally-imbalanced teens. While I’m not sure I totally agree, it sounds good, and fits with my narrative about Harry’s life mirroring your own as a reader. </p>

<p> On a more textual level, the third book does a great job of using its internal structures to build the world. Lupin’s defense against the dark arts classes deal with the various magical animals, most of which will come up again in later books. I think this is a great way to help build a world, and helps the narrative considerably in following books, as seen in Mrs. Weasley’s breakdown in book 6, the second task in book 4, and more. The second and third books make great use of classroom time to help carry the story. In book two, DADA classes were a comedic relief. In book three, DADA classes help to flesh out the universe of the magical world. Compare this to the absolute lack of description of any classes in book 1, wasted potential. </p>

<p> Sirius black goes from one of the most hated characters to one of the most loved characters in the span of 50 pages. I had an unshakable mental image of “JK Rowling’s instant good-guy mix, just add water!” It’s interesting to analyze the ways in which Black grows on the hearts. He gives gifts to both Harry and Ron, a broomstick and an owl respectively. He shows courage to hold off Lupin, and he says nice things about Harry’s parents (which we all know is the way to Harry’s heart). After Pettigrew is returned to human form, Sirius compares nicely to the ratty and groveling man. </p>

<p> Something noticeably good about book three is how JK avoids making Sirius feel retconned in. We’re three books deep into the series, throwing a majorly important character into the mix now is off-putting to say the least. Except Sirius was mentioned in the second chapter of the first book, his photo appears in the Harry’s photo album, and his arrival into the story is aided by the catalyst of Scabbers (Peter Pettigrew) who had been in the story since the first train ride to Hogwarts. All these factors make him feel less like a new character, and more like one who was just off screen. </p>

<p> Finally, the third book does a good job of introducing objects to help carry the story in future books. The owl that Sirius gives to Ron provides the possibility of contact over the summers between the two of them. The Marauder’s map (in tandem with the invisibility cloak) helps Harry & co. navigate the school and avoid expulsion on their adventures, allowing for the events in later books to transpire. </p>

<b> Look Above</b>

<div class="col1">







<p> I got frustrated this week over my naval academy
application. <br>



The online form plays out like an ad-lib for secondary
school achievement: “My favorite varsity team was (blank), I was well liked and
my class’s (stu gov role), between practice and church service I serve my
community by (volunteer experience). </p>



<p> It’s not the fault of the application, or of the
academy. It does a great job of recognizing the effort and hard work that goes
into achievement. The reason it twists my stomach is because it pulls emphasis
away from my back-breaking (literally. See my powerlifting training) college
experience and focuses on my less-than-stellar High School performance. </p>



<p> See, I was your typical gifted but lazy High
Schooler (a laziness which did not extend to my full-time-part-time job washing
dishes). I had double digit absences per annum, slept through AP Bio, and got a
5 on my AP Language and Composition test without bothering to study. I remember
walking into school one day (late) to discover that the SAT was being given, I
borrowed a pencil, and landed in the 95th national percentile. I can
safely say that I graduated High School without ever conjugating ‘to study’
into the present or past tense. </p>



<b> Laziness and Fear
</b>



<p> I don’t believe I was (or am) truly lazy. I
believe that laziness is just a symptom of something deeper. Laziness is the
visible tip of a much deeper iceberg. </p>



<p> I was afraid of failure. </p>



<p> Let’s put aside the obvious: of course a component
of the ‘lazy-but-gifted’ complex is the total lack of good habits to build
success upon. No organizational skill. No self-disciple. No intra or extra
motivation to accomplish school work. No study habits. No idea how
<i>to</i> study. Messy or nonexistent notetaking. Poor attendance.
Etc etc. This is all epidermal stuff. </p>



<p> When you’re young and gifted, you don’t fail, then
you grow older, you head off to middle school and you still can’t fail- but
things start to feel tougher, some days the answers aren’t in your head by the
time the teacher finishes talking, and now you’re in High School, and there’s a
possibility of failing. </p>



<p> I don’t mean like “fail the class” failing. No,
I’m talking about trying and failing. What if I put my head down, worked as
hard as I could on a project and it only got a 90. Is my best a 90? That’s a
frightening prospect. The paralyzing fear here is to pour your gifted self into
something, to try, to put effort in, to labor over something, only to find out
that you failed to do well. </p>



<p> It isn’t laziness. It’s just much easier to say:
“Oh yeah, that calc test? Got an 87. Never even studied though.” Than it is to
say: “That calc test? I was studying for weeks, but I only got a 94.”
</p>



<p> You are totally frozen. To melt and pour yourself
into something means risking disappointment. And so you hide in the shadow of
that numerical gap between your achievement and what your achievement could be
(the upper bound of which is unknown). </p> 



<p> This position means settling, rather than
striving. To be happy with less, because you know it is below you. You know
(and everyone else too) that if you tried harder you would do better, but trying
harder would reveal your real limit, and your fear of that limit keeps you
frozen. </p>







<p> It’s such a deceptively comfortable positon, like
the sweetness of the venus fly trap. 







<b> Simple Syntax
</b>



<p> I’ve been doing a lot of introspection. It’s
probably because of the 2+ hour commutes I do daily, or the constant state of
brain anesthetic which comes with a tedious job. </p>



<p> I’ve come to realize that all those little
phrases, the ones spewed by school staff and repeated ad nauseam, have a lot
more meaning than you thought they did when you initially heard and ignored
them. Phrases that sound so stupid and shallow like: “Don’t be afraid to fail”
or “try your best”, actually can mean a lot. </p>



<p> The biggest irony is that a fear of failure has
led me to more failure than I could have ever predicted. But I’m done with it.
I’ll blowtorch every icy appendage, I’ll pour every cubic mL into my SAT
retake, into my fitness test, into my application, no holding back, no buts, no
escape clause. No fear. </p>



<p> I’m going to find that upper bound. </p>

<p>to want is not to live, because to live in want, is not to live at all, he said, and look above, black spaces filled with plastic stars, hurtling down, down, down a hill at two am, tires whizzing the way they do, on asphalt that’s just a little wet, but no, slosh and slosh and slosh we go, bulbs hang and glow with light like spoiled squash, and now above, the sun is pouring down, cream ‘cross the horizon, light and sweet morning on your eyes, there’s coffee on your tongue, jerk awake, and topple out of bed, it seems my seams have split, get up he says, you’ve weeks to fill, and fill you will and fill you must, there’s knurling in your hands, so grit your teeth and brace and pull, he pauses, till your heart, the cheap balloons it is, goes splatter in your chest, out comes all the sap, stuck like a pig, tapped like a tree, your blood comes pouring free, you know you have a number, you’ve got eighty years at best, it’s tattooed across the vena cava, the beats you’ve had, the beats you will, there goes one, and another, slipping slipping gone forever, he leans in close, so now you know, the path ahead is thick with swamps and seas, and you wouldn’t be the first, to get lost along the way, but think, how lucky that you are, to beat your life away.</p>

<b>Goals, Dreams</b>

<p> First real post on my new blog, let’s go! <br>I’ll be outlining all my plans and goals and dreams as well as what steps I’m taking to reach them. </p>

<b>Transferring </b>

<p> Starting with the most important goal: leaving Southern Connecticut State University far behind. </p>

<p> Faithful readers and friends will know (and be tired of hearing about) how badly that I want to transfer to the United States Naval Academy. </p>

<p> I don’t want to bash Southern too hard, It’s a great school, really. It’s just not <b>my</b> school. I don’t even think I want to try and transmute those feelings into words. Simply put, everything from the classes to the people to the food to the parking garages, leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth and a twist in my gut. </p>

<p> It’s not my school. </p>

<p> Transferring is tough. Especially to a school with single digit admissions and an application process comparable to one of those competitive TV shows. I’m determined to do everything I can to get in. </p>

<b> Grass is always greener </b>

<p> I have always struggled with enjoying the present. Before I had my license all I could think about was driving, now I commute to work and wish fervently that I could bike.   </p>

<p> It’s one of those deep-down human condition things that we can never truly shake off. Personally, I just really need to focus on finding joy in the everyday. I can’t live my life looking for greener grass and trample the grass under my feet. </p>


<b> Blocking it out </b>

<p> Sadness can manifest itself in many ways. It’s like those cough medicines which send some people into dreamland and act like cocaine on others (I myself fall into the latter category). </p>

<p> Similarly, when someone is sad they can react in the expected dreary-lethargic way, or they can become hyperactive, spam their Snapchat story with adventures, kick life into high gear, work a job, join a gym, smile and laugh a whole lot and generally be absolutely dead inside. </p>
<p> Something else I need to keep in mind is to be aware of this. In my own life and others. To take a breath. </p>


<b> Athletic training </b>

<p><b>Powerlifting</b>: I have a meet in three weeks! I must admit I’m really nervous and really excited. I’ve been training 2-3 hours a day for 5 days a week for a couple months now. I’ve gotten a few dents and bruises here and there, but I’ve got the fire in my belly, I want to lift some goddamn weight. </p>

<p> I am aiming to total >1050lbs in my competition. </p>

<p><b>Rowing/Cycling</b>: My favorite forms of cardio. I’ve been doing lots of conditioning on the erg (rowing machine). Conditioning work is generally done in intervals. 1 minute on, 1 minute off (either resting or slow paced). This has made a huge difference in how I feel throughout the day. I feel like many lifters would do well to incorporate some cardio. I’ve always loved cycling, ever since my dad took me to the baseball diamond at my elementary school and taught me how to bike around the bases. When it got too dark that night to bike anymore, I went home covered in dust, with a new love. By practicing cycling and rowing, I help condition myself, and keep them as a backup in case I want to pursue a sport other than powerlifting (of which I have reservations) at the Naval Academy. </p>

<p> I am aiming for a 7minute 2k erg time. </p> 

<p><b>CFA</b>: The candidate fitness assessment is the physical test which counts as ~10% of admissions to the Naval Academy. After my Powerlifting meet I will be changing my focus to train for it specifically. More running, more push-ups and pull-ups and sit-ups. Boy they do love their –ups. </p>

<p> I have been working on a specific training program for the CFA, I’ll post it when I finish it. </p>

<p><b>Grip training</b>: I have been working sporadically to increase my grip strength. I want to be able to close the 1.5 CoC gripper, and do a 2 minute deadhang. </p>

<p> Other sports I have interest in trying/playing: boxing, soccer, tennis, wrestling, strongman, Olympic weightlifting. </p>

<b> Job update </b>

<p> Currently I am working for the State of Connecticut, in the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP). </p>
<p> Overall I really like my job. Good hours, good pay, I get to listen to audiobooks. The only downside is that the basement in which I work makes me pale, and sometimes after listening to audiobooks for 7+ hours I feel as if I am losing my mind. </p>

<p> When I head back to school I will have to reassess staying with the State, or returning to my cushy campus job. </p>


<b> Projects </b>

<p> one of my (admittedly many) faults is that I love to start projects and hate to finish them. So many stories, essays, websites, workout routines, spreadsheets, Linux scripts, mods, texture packs, ROM hacks, have fallen prey to this. </p>

<p> I want to fix this. In my very limited free time I have been attempting to return to all these old projects and finish them. When I do, you can bet I’ll post them here. </p>

<b>Finances </b>

<p> I’ll keep this short. Below is a list of financial goals I want to meet. </p>
<ul>
<li> $2,500 emergency fund (NAVYFED MMSA) </li>
<li> $2,500 stock portfolio (INDEXED) </li>
<li> Pay off my first year of college. </li>
<li> Stay on track with my budget (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XxVT3H1-l5yDF0fWPd3etC-cLzjJvyYFr2bW9f-ZRIc/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet here</a>)</li>
</ul>


<b> SAT </b>
<p> I also plan on retaking the SAT. I’ll be studying with Khan Academy and aiming for a 1400-1500 score. This isn’t all that interesting so let’s move on. </p>


<b> Life is not a training montage </b>

<p> I find that this is a really bad perspective that many people fall into. Those cheesy videos of boxers or athletes training, perfectly clipped together with orchestral music and motivational voice overs, that’s great and all, but it’s hollow. <p>
<p> Winners are not the ones who had the most motivation to do something, who listened to inspirational speakers and threw themselves into training. Winners are the ones who throw themselves into training without the motivation, on every single day even when they don’t feel like it. The people who get ahead are the ones who train when they feel awful, when they would rather be doing anything else. Motivation will not help you, motivation is fleeting. At the first sign of a cold, or an injury, or more interesting plans are mentioned, your motivation will abandon you. What you need is discipline, a habit, a way of life, which lends itself to progress. </p>

<p> At the end of the day: You are what you continually do, not who you continually want to be. </p>


<b> You are not a machine </b>

<p> At the same time, you need to remember that you are not a machine. You have not been programmed to execute a set task to train for a sport or get ahead in life. </p>

<p> To be human is to be weak. You will have bad days, feel alone, feel sad, feel broken, be broken, all those fun and happy states of being. </p>

<p> Again this is just the human condition, I interact with a lot of people online who try to leave humanity behind in their quest to get better grades, be more productive at a job, lift some big weights, this is a mistake. Pushing aside friendships, family, personal time, hobbies, anything and everything to squeeze more productivity out of yourself like a goddamn juice box is a mistake. </p>

<p> Trust me. </p>

<b>my first pl meet</b>
        <p> On July 21st, I competed in my first ever Powerlifting meet. </p>
        <p>I had to weigh in at 205 pounds to make weight for the 93kg class. </p>
        <p> Unfortunately, the day before the meet, my scale was still reading 210. Oh no. I shot a text to my friend Ayla, who knows more about powerlifting than I ever will, and she outlined a crash diet for me. It worked, too well. When I weighed in the next day, I was only 200. </p>     
        <p> In the first of many mistakes, I only brought two PB&J sandwiches to eat after weighing in. Which turns out, is not enough to fully offset the metabolic damage that I had done to myself the previous day. <p>
        <p>Worse still, my face, neck, and left arm were covered in eruptions of poison ivy. I itched terribly, and looked dreadful. I looked like a sort of plague victim, who had chosen to lift in a Powerlifting meet through the make-a-wish foundation. </p>
        <p> When I say that this powerlifting meet was an educational experience I mean that in so many ways. Here’s one: I started off completely embarrassed by what I felt was an indecently short singlet. It was an Inzer singlet I had borrowed from the gym, a brand known to hug the upper thigh. I was so thrown off by this that I screwed up squatting the 45lbs bar during warm ups. A great way to start the meet. <p>
        <p> By the time I took my opener, I was over this, people had assured me it was fine. By the end of the meet, I liked the singlet so much that I ordered my own. </p>
        <p> My opening squat was 352.2lbs. An easy number. I had hit it for a triple a week prior. </p>
        <p>The gym had been split into two areas, a stage was separated from the warm-up area by a thin black curtain. I was in a disorganized line behind this curtain waiting to be called to the platform. <p>
        <p> My coach put chalk across my shoulders, he was saying something, but I couldn’t hear him over the metal I had blasting both my eardrums apart. I was called. I hurried out to the platform as quickly as I could. This walk, between the edge of the curtain and the waiting barbell was strange to me. I felt so uncomfortable walking to the barbell, but right at home when I started setting up. This is probably because all of my training revolves around squatting, and none of it revolves around a watching crowd. <p>
        <p> I take my squat grip, index fingers just outside the rings, a wide grip for my inflexible shoulder girdle. I have my Rouge belt nice and tight, I love the softness of the leather, I love the simplicity of a single prong belt, and I love the feeling of lifting with a belt on. For my first meet I am not wearing knee sleeves or wrist wraps, we’re going raw baby. </p>
        <p> One glaring fault in my powerlifting is my lack of a template, a total understanding of the lift to be repeated and perfected. All the best lifters always work from a template in their heads, a template of the lift grinded into the fibers of their body through repetition. For every one of their lifts, they take the same breathes, do the same cues, execute the lift the same way. I don’t have this. </p>
        <p> I squat easily. <p>
        <p> My next attempt is 380.3lbs. I hit that one easily too. It feels as though the deload has done some magic for my squat. I barely feel the weight, I feel fluid and powerful. </p>
        <p>The feeling of lifting in the meet was like nothing that I had ever felt before. Completely different from lifting in training. My eyes were open, but I couldn’t see in front of me. My thoughts were racing, but my mind was blank. Music was blasting, but I was deaf. It was such an intense and obsessive focus, the likes of which I had never felt before. It was like in that moment I existed just to lift a barbell.</p>
        <p> Before my final squat, 402.3lbs, I gulp some electrolyte water. Disgusting stuff honestly, tangy, metallic, Gatorade-y, gross. I picked up a bottle at Rite-Aid and am deeply regretting it. </p>
        <p> 402 flies up and I get three more white lights. 3/3 so far! </p>
        <p> I hate benching. I hate bench press with my entire being. Undoubtedly because I am bad at it. My arms are too long, my arch is not even an arch, I have absolutely no leg drive, I have no strength off the chest, and I have a lot of difficulty stacking the wrist, forearm, and elbow to ensure good leverage. Did I mention I hate benching? </p>
        <p> The back room is crammed with lifters; I’m sharing the bench with at least 4 other guys. In between each warmup we have to adjust the weight, and change rack heights, and wait for the next guy to go through his 30 second set up which looks like the construction of a suspension bridge. My warm up gets rushed. </p>
        <p> My opener, 242.5 lbs, and my second attempt, 264.6 lbs both go up without trouble. Out of all the lifts, my crash diet seems to have effected my bench the most. It doesn’t feel great. </p>
        <p> My third attempt of 270.1 is where it all falls apart. The center could not hold. After the press command I get the bar an inch up, maybe two, and it stops dead. I struggle with it, but it doesn’t budge. The spotters grab it. Three red lights. </p>
        <p> I’m not too bothered; it only confirms the deep rooted hatred that I have for benching. I also have the type of personality that can let things go and move on to the next hurdle. I focus on deadlifting. </p>
        <p> The final stretch! I drank some water, and took the shirt off that I had been wearing under my singlet. My friend Ryan even gave me some of his rice cakes. Those things are delicious. My coach put baby powder on my legs to help the bar slide up. All around I was feeling pretty good. </p>
        <p> My opener of 380 flew up, my second attempt of 413 flew up too. </p>
        <p> I had underestimated how long meets actually take. 3 attempts at 3 lifts, each attempt taking one minute, 9 minutes per person, 17 or so people competing, should be around 2 hours right? Wrong. Try 5. </p>
        <p> The good thing was that besides my gnawing hunger, the time was flying by. Everyone was amazing. All the people who I had trained with had showed up, and were screaming encouragement during the lifts. It was as if the atmosphere was electric. Lots of fist bumps and back claps and hugs all around. </p>
        <p> Let’s give some shout outs. My buddy Grant was there, who frequently uses polysyllabic strength and conditioning terms, my nutritionist pal Kelly was announcing, my go-to person for anything food related, Ayla was there, probably the strongest girl that I have ever met, who also was the one to push me to sign up for this meet, Luke was there, the guy has a badass beard and awesome lifts. Another pal Ryan was competing along with me, even Tim, a strongman with strength a couple of exponents higher than mine was there. </p>
        <p> It was time for my final lift. A 429.9lbs deadlift. Like they had promised, my song came on, Meddler by August burns red. If anything will get you fired up for a big lift, metal will. It was an easy lift. I barely felt the bar in my hands. Three white lights. </p>
        <p> The thing about powerlifting is that by and large the meet is a forgone conclusion. The real powerlifting experience is the daily grind, getting strong bit by bit, learning new techniques and movements and protocols to help training, meeting people along the way, meeting people to scream and cheer for you when you lift. Powerlifting is a journey, not a destination. I think there’s something very beautiful about that. </p>

<p>In my chemistry class we had to use the Q-test to determine whether or not to discard results before calculating standard deviation on the percentage of  sulfate in an unknown compound. </p>
<p>If you dont know, this is the Q-Test: </p>
 <img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dc8082d4edde68d53ffc98a70c7c0f2dd2d56c03" style="padding: 20px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>Where:<br> gap = abs(outlier - nearest neightbor)<br> range = (highest value - lowest value)</p>
<p>This is probably a horrible solution, but I really did not want to do the Q-Test 12 times by hand.</p>

<p>It's a trend I see all the time in my INQ 101 student's and myself. </p>
    <p><strong>You have an assignment due.</strong></p>
    <p>What do you do?<br>
    Do you start work on the project?</p>

<strong>Hell no.</strong>
<p>You organize your folders, clean your room, change your lockscreen, clear out your email inbox, empty out your backpack, lay out clothes for tomorrow, check social media, maybe you even write a blog post.</p>
<p>    
 Because you aren't a <em>lazy</em> or how dare I even mention <em>unproductive</em> person, you decide the best thing to do is make an outline of the project. Who cares if the outline doesn't <em>really</em> help you complete the project at all. </p>


<p>This is <strong>quid pro quo productivity</strong>, something for something productivity. It's a form of avoidance where instead of doing what's <em>really</em> important, we focus on other tasks, ones which are easier, to keep ourselves busy. Keeping busy makes us feel all nice and warm and fuzzy and productive, when the real work is being left undone.</p>

<p>Using Euclid's algorithm.</p>

<b>Week of Turning Points</b>

<p>Monday:<br>
I ran out of gas in Middletown, and learned about inertia on the rolling hills. In Hartford, I interviewed for a job at the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP). During my evening workout, I squatted 365lbs for two easy reps, doubling my previous record. </p>

<p>Tuesday:<br>
I had my sutures removed. I’ll always have a scar above my left eye, a reminder to tie my shoes before farmer’s walks. I ate a decadent 1000+ calorie Cinnabon. My competition bench training was pain free, and I made delicious homemade cold brew coffee. </p>

<p>Wednesday:<br>
The day began with an awful deadlift session (it lacked caffeine and metal), and ended learning about healthy social interactions from telenovelas. I was offered a job at the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. </p>

<p>Thursday:<br>
Finally! I overhead pressed 185lbs. My CoC #1 gripper came in the mail. I can almost close it. I made this new blog layout. Bit of a slow, blue day. </p>

<p>Friday:<br>
Today I started work at CT DEEP. The building is old and beautiful, like a Manhattan transplant. I bought lunch from a food truck, ate in Bushnell park. 
</p>

<p>Saturday:<br>
I had a great training session: supinated rows, snatch grip rows, volume leg press. Played tennis. Splurged on sushi (in a physical and financial sense). Walked along the beach and discovered the only cactus native to Connecticut, The Eastern Prickly Pear (Opuntia humifusa). </p>

<p>Sunday:<br>
I caught up with some old friends who I hadn’t seen since high school. We had a great time. We went out for sushi (again) and screwed around in a local mall. It’s not what you do, its who you’re with. </p>
      <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.4/latest.js?config=AM_CHTML"></script>

Don't judge me. I read 1,744 pages of YA literature for most of the early morning hours of march 9th. I am very ashamed to admit it but I read the entire original series of Percy Jackson.
        </p>
        <p>After catching a few hours of sleep, I visited the museum of american art in New Britan CT. Just for a little redemption.</p>
        
        <p>The museum had this, which I thought this was an interesting painting:</p>
        <p>It's westrock, right in that Woodbridge, New Haven, Hamden area. Right where I am going to school right now, in all of it's unspoiled beauty. Also annoyingly google photos does not make it easy to embed media. Ugh.</p>

<p>After many, many, many, far too many reboots, I have finished this site. Actually, it's more accurate to say that I am finished <i>with</i> this site. I just don't care anymore. Things will never be perfect, never exactly how I want, never the perfect font, never responsive enough, never slim enough, never sleek enough. So I have given up. </p>
        
        <p>Look at this. 310 commits. > 13,000 additions, and nearly as many deletions. The definition of a time sink, exactly the type of quid-pro-quo productivity that I try to avoid. (If you don't know, Quid Pro Quo productivity is what I like to call the process of doing something which feels productive to escape the real, more pressing, responsibilities). I've also given up on policing myself in terms of content. I had some rose tinted fantasy about a text only website in the year 2019, which bordered on luddism. From now on I will post anything, text, image, gif, whatever. </p>
        
        <p>If you can't tell already, this is raw, unfiltered, rough. I'm sure some things that I throw up on this site will be a little more polished, but I realized my perfectionist side was preventing me from posting anything here. </p>
        
        <p>So what's new?</p>
        
        <p>Spring break started today. All I had was one recitation class before freedom. Most people in my CHE 121 class seem very confused about the units of various rates, but with a little algebra it's super easy to derive. </p>
        
        <p>Imagine you are trying to find the units for a second order reaction rate.<center>`rate = k[A]^2`</center><br>We are looking for the units of k, and we know that the units can be whatever we want, as long as we end up with:<br><br><center>`(mol)/(l*s)`</center><br>Since we also know that the [A] represents the concentraion of the solution, and has units of Molarity, we can set up the following:<br><center>`(mol)/(l*s) = k*((mol)/(l))^2`</center><br><center>`k=(l)/(mol*s)`</center></p>
        
        
        <p>I did nothing useful today. I played west point bridge designer, a great game. Here's a gif of my $192,000 bridge.</p>
   <b> Basics </b>
<p> ‘StepHep’ is inspired by old school strongman Doug Hepburn. This program aims to build up my weak points, and provide a fresh way for me to progress. </p>

<p> The accessory movements provided are tailored towards my goals. They should be changed to better suit your needs. </p>

    <p> Use 80% of your 1RM for the heavy lifts. <br>
        Use 60% of your 1RM for the volume lifts. <br>
        90-120 seconds of rest between sets.

    <b> Progression </b>

<p> Progression is very simple. After every successful workout add a rep to the end of each exercise. </p>

<p>Imagine you complete all deadlift reps on Monday (2/2/2/2/2/2/2/2), next deadlift session you will pull (2/2/2/2/2/2/2/3), and the session after that (2/2/2/2/2/2/3/3), and the following session (2/2/2/2/2/3/3/3). </p>

<p> This will continue until you complete 8x3. When you complete 8x3 you add 10lbs to the bar and start over at 8x2. </p>

<p> It may feel slow. It may not seem like much. But over the course of a year you will add 120lbs to every lift.</p>
<b>Half Marathon</b>

<p>A little bit too late, on the way to the race actually, I realize I’ve never run more than a mile in my life.</p>

<p>Only five minutes to go. The national anthem is played. We're all crowded up behind an inflatable arch with ‘start’ spelled across in sans-serif white. </p>

<p> My younger brother is wrapping the cords of his headphones around his ears. I’m thinking about the differences between girls who run long distance, and girls who powerlift. </p>

<p>There are many. </p>

<p>I only kept up with my brother for half a mile. He promised to stick with me, but I wave him forward, and let the dry-fit crowd swallow him up. </p>

<p>The sky, which has hung heavy and cerebral all day, finally breaks open and hurls showers towards the earth. My phone screen goes black and refuses to turn back on no matter how frantically I tap the screen or press the lock button. </p>

 <p>Running and powerlifting seem to exist on two ends of a spectrum. During my meet I was blank, a hinge, a structural support, I was a human distilled down into some simple machine. But as I plod through puddles and up hills, my mind is wandering, my legs are out of focus, moving sloppily beneath me, kicking up rain, I’ve dissociated completely. </p>

 <p> I'm thinking about all the fonts on all the sponsored shirts around me. I'm thinking about what this must look like from above, a rainbow snake slithering through an upscale suburban town, slowly coming apart as the group divides into smaller and smaller groups of runners. </p>

<p> There are more hills. I slip further back, further into the snake of the race, I feel it constricting my calves. </p>

<p>Figures loom out of the rain in colorful L.L Bean raincoats, shouting encouragement, offering cups of water. My brother has instructed me to sip, not gulp. I don't know why. The water makes me feel better. </p>

<p>Everyone runs with careful foot strikes, robotic, carrying out some programmed function, executing line after line of code, feeding themselves into the compiler of the race. I feel defective. </p>




<p>Back on the dissociative thought train. I’m thinking about how automation requires humanity to rethink purpose. We are designed to survive long enough to reproduce, but as we delegate every demand on our bodies to inanimate hardware, is there a meaning in existence without survival? There is something very human about a wounded gait. </p>    

 <p>My right calf has become a cement pillar, shoulder and side stab sporadically, my hamstrings feel like the end of a log being slowly lowered into a wood chipper. I am thinking frantically about all the types of injuries I could get. I'm hoping that when the injury comes, it's not serious, not a knee blowing out, not a hamstring pulling, not a piece of me falling out and bringing me crumbling to the ground like a Jenga tower. </p>

<p> I must be close. We’re running along a seawall that keeps an iron sea at bay. The race had started at a beach. I must be close. An ambulance idles on the side of the road, waiting for someone like me to keel over. </p>

<p> I really don’t know if I can make it. My legs are wobble on every footfall. I can’t bend at the knees anymore, so I’m forced into a limp-hop-trip-hobble type of choppy step. A woman runs by me, “Come on pork chop,” she says. </p>

<p>I see it. The inflatable arch. The finish line. <p>

<p>I cross it. </p>

<p> I finished in just over two hours. I know I know, very slow for a 19-year-old male, but I’m still proud regardless. <p>


<p>Everything from my old blog. Starting from the first post. March 11th, 2018. </p>

<b>Spring Break</b>
<p class="tag2">March 11th, 2018.</p>
<p>The world may be trying to kill me.<br>
Last week a real estate agent crashed into my car on the parkway, a backyard tree collapsed right where I had been standing, and I burned my mouth on a pizza topping. <br>
Some of these are more severe than others. </p>
<p>At least it’s spring break, which will give me a chance to collect myself (and replace my missing passenger side mirror).<br>
I hate sitting around, so I am making this blog to keep myself busy and accountable over break.<br>
I have lots of plans for things that I want to get done: homework, hiking trips, gym sessions, car repairs, creative writing, video editing, reading, cooking, seeing friends, video games, and more. <br>            </p>
<p>Stay busy, stay happy. </p>  

<b> Sleeping Giant</b>
<p class="tag2">March 12th, 2018.</p>
<p>I went hiking today!<br>
In retrospect it was not my brightest idea to go for a rugged climb after a night of snowfall. Especially wearing Asics with soles like sea glass. Every trail was covered in a layer of compact snow. Luckily there were only a few close calls and a very wet pair of pants. Quinnipiac looked beautiful from the top of the blue trail. </p>

<p>I need to start pulling together a class schedule for next semester. It seems as if I will be confined to Connecticut for another year at least. More on this as it develops. </p>

<p>Later, in a booth at North Haven’s “Athena II” diner, I overheard the most interesting conversation between two men. It spanned halfway houses, schizophrenia, the pope, the possibilities for life after death, and the underground trade of supermarket coupons. I hope when I’m middle aged that I’ll be able to meet friends in dinners and have similar conversations. </p>

<p>In the PM I hit the gym. Still running the nsuns 5day routine (against my better judgment). Bench press felt fine. I added conventional curls after two sets of hammer curls. When doing T2 overhead press I rowed the weight for sets of 20. After 5 sets I felt my forearms give out. Pumped, stiff, with jittering fingers, it was great. </p>

<p> See you space cowboy...</p>   
<b> Snow Day</b>
<p class="tag2">March 13th, 2018.</p>
<p>Didn’t go to the gym. Didn’t clean my room. Didn’t get any homework done. Didn’t go anywhere. So why am I still happy with today? <br>
Let me tell you.<br> I have been meandering around the idea of trying to crack my way into the United States Naval Academy, and today I decided I was going to do it. This is a big deal. Now I know which direction to go in, and what I have to do. Not only that! I’ve decided I want to be an English major. I love language, and books, and reading, and just all of it. </p>
<p>This just means that I will be running a bit more, shooting for at least one powerlifting meet, and maybe retaking the SATs. </p>
<p>It’s an exciting road ahead, but now it’s time for bed. </p>
<p> The boat is launched, let's chase the horizon.</p>

<b> coffee, empty stomachs</b>

<b> wonton soup</b>
<p class="tag2">March 15th, 2018.</p> 

<p> Another post filled with scattered thoughts. <br>
I am sipping from a mug of wonton soup as I type this. I always order it from the same Chinese restaurant. I feel as though someone has staged a coup and restructured the place. They never used to give plastic takeout containers, only metal. Their wonton soup stock used to have more scallions and was less colloidal. Worse still, the nice hostess with the shallow-water eyes seems to have been fired. <br>
I can only hope that she has received a large inheritance or has started a new life as a coal baron or perhaps is now the captain of a fishing trawler in the South China Sea. </p>
<p> I worked out today. <br>
Still need to stretch & run. <br>
At least I am finishing my nsuns workouts. <br>
Something that I noticed today was that changing my grip while doing barbell curls made them more comfortable. Normally, the <del>external rotation</del> radial deviation from the straight bar puts a strain on my forearm, but when I switched to a ‘false grip’ it felt a lot better! <br>
From now on I will be sticking with hammer and barbell curls for bicep work. </p>
<p> There are days when I hate my Macbook Pro, and today was one of them. <br>
I needed to install a third party program off github (that was in alpha!) to be able to control the audio levels for various applications. This <b>simple</b> functionality is completely missing from OSX. It really boils my blood that people pay top dollar for these slick, apple embossed, steel brushed laptops; only to find that if they are locked into controlling one big master volume dial. </p>
<p> I made another video today. <br>
Link is <a href=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KfmxuwU-u4&list=LLn_AIk8YHs6s-QbktQh_XCQ&index=1”>here</a>! I was inspired by my favorite anime, Neon Genesis Evangelion, to create a mix of songs that reflect the somber outlook of Shinji Ikari. It’s an excellent mix to study to. <br>
I am trying really hard to make a couple videos before my 30-day trial of final cut pro runs out. <br>
Lord knows I can’t afford it. </p>
<p>What are blogs if not random musings?</p>   


<b> gluttony & sloth</b>
<p class="tag2">March 16th, 2018.</p> 
<p> I almost did not write a post today. <br>
Today was okay. I feel slightly guilty about how unproductive it was. <br>
I purchased a new pair of shoes for the gym. Not much else. </p>
<p> My poor stomach. I had all you can eat sushi for lunch and eye-watering wings for dinner. My innards feel like a washer’s heavy load spin cycle. </p>
<p> In more positive news: I saw an old friend today. Let’s call him D. We worked out (not really), got food, and caught up. <br>
D and I graduated from the same high school last year. We mostly talked about who else we had seen from our class and what everyone was up to. <br>
That’s what you talk about with old classmates it seems. </p>
<p> Speaking of school, I set up a meeting with my advisor and have been pulling together a few schedules for next semester. </p>
<p> I have homework that needs to be done, a gym session to be made up, tickets to be paid, schedules to be made, emails to be read, and my eyelids have elephants on them. </p>
<p> Today slipped by like salmon through the maw of a grizzly.<br> I’m sorry.<br> When I’m tired I make bad nature similes. </p>   


<b> old ink</b>
<p class="tag2">March 17th, 2018.</p> 
 <p> One thing that I love about writing these daily little blog posts is how it has gotten me writing again. I love coming back to my computer and seeing an open word doc with a half-finished post. </p>
<p> As part of my dantean trek to the Naval Academy I am going to start running with my younger brother. He runs both varsity track and cross country so I am sure that he will leave me in the dust. </p>    
<p>I never finished writing this.</p>


<b> scapula blues</b>
<p class="tag2">March 20th, 2018.</p> 
 <p> I think I overdid It with the barbell rows. </p>
<p> I’ve been in excruciating pain recently. I think I ripped the muscles of my upper back, possibly the connective tissue. <br>
Puffing my chest out hurts. Breathing hurts. Retracting my scapula hurts. Sitting hurts. Laying down hurts. <br>
<br>It’s the wakeup call I needed. <br>
Since I started working out I’ve carelessly neglected stretching or warming up. <br>
I’ve started. For the past two days I have followed the <a href=”https://phrakture.github.io/starting-stretching.html”>Starting Stretching</a> routine and It’s been great! Hopefully it’s just not too late for me and my incredibly tight hamstrings and hip flexors. </p>

<p>I think I will be making a before/after video to show the difference that a month of stretching makes. </p>

<p>I hate this constant pain. It is so hard to focus on my stack of homework while I’m aching, while I can’t sit up, while I can’t sleep. </p>

<p>I will be switching from the nsunsLP routine to a PPL. Taking Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday off and then starting on Thursday. Or maybe a different program? Hepburn inspired routines seem cool as well. It’s something I need to put thought into. </p>

<p> I want to try out the zercher squat and the steinborn squat!</p>

<p> I also want to replay a couple video games from my youth. </p>

    <p> So much to do. So little time.</p>

<p> More than a foot of snow en route to bury CT again. </p>

<p class="tag2">March 21st, 2018.</p> 
<p> Thank god.<br>My political science midterm was moved to Friday. </p>
<p> School closes at 12 today– means I escape the clutches of my evening shift. <br>
Busy day. I’ve been working on a new fitness routine to replace nsunsLP. I also have a few essays to sand down. </p>
<p> This site’s markup looks like impressionist finger painting from a toddler’s fever dream. I should probably clean it up. Make a separate css file. Try and stick to a format. <br>But how can I do that if I can't even bother to write complete sentences for these posts?
<p> In good news my back is feeling much better. Looks like I just ripped up my rhomboids, serratus anterior, traps, etc etc.</p>
<p> Too busy to write much. </p>


<b>pulled plug</b>
<p class="tag2">March 23rd, 2018.</p> 
<p> I’ll be dashing to the gym in half an hour so this should be a quick post. <br>
I’ve decided that from now until Monday morning (3/26/18), I'll be cutting down on the phone use.<br> Just as a break. To enjoy the present a little more. To stop worrying over silly things.  </p>
<p> I think it will be good for me. </p>

<p> Thoughts: <br>
“We are a school of small spoons in a big cutlery drawer” <br>
“You don't know your real friends until they tell you they won't help you return the ti89 titanium graphing calculator that you bought from target” <br>
I need to transfer. Perhaps not to the Naval Academy? <br>
I’m going to replay half-life tonight I think. <br>
Wizard people, dear reader is great, so is Freeman’s mind <br>
I really need to learn how to use commas huh. That would help things. <br>
Still need to finish Productivity Project + make a book page <br>
So tired of so many people. <br>
I am going to join the book club. </p>
<p>Oh this post is so... sandpaper, a cat's tongue, turf on a cold night, a dry throat, oak tree bark, roofing shingles, bristles across a cheek, OSB Plywood, rough. Whatever.

<b>april is the cruelest month</b>
<p class="tag2">April 3rd, 2018.</p> 
 <p> I’m working really hard on getting it together. It can get really difficult when you’re on the treadmill of life and every step forward feels like you’re moving in place. <p>

<p> So what am I doing to pull it together? <br>
Narrowing my focus. </p>

<p> I have been trying (failing) to juggle so many things. I have been trying (failing) to commit myself to a course of action and stick with it. Narrowing my focus means cutting the fluff, cutting out the time wasters and dead ends of my life. This does not mean I am going to lock myself in my room, blockade the door with books and never leave a productive cocoon. This doesn’t work. Trust me I’ve tried. It just means that I will use my time on important things and waste my time on things that truly bring me happiness, that enrich my life, that I enjoy. For a nerd like me that might be re-watching Star Trek, or reading, or spending time with people who I enjoy the company of. </p>

<p> My Geography professor last semester had a way of describing college. Arriving at college is like standing on the shore, looking out at the ocean, you arrive young, dumb, and clueless. Choosing a major is lashing together driftwood to build a raft. Taking classes is paddling out into the water. Some rifts will sink. Statistically more than half of college hopefuls will drop out. Some paddle out a short ways and realize they built the wrong raft, they dive out and swim back to shore. In four or so years your battered craft will cross the lagoon, and you’ll cross the stage of graduation. </p> 

<p> I think that I have been playing around on the shore for too long. </p> 

<p> So let’s put an end to this thumb twiddling. I’m declaring as a geology major. I’ve always loved sciences. I adored AP bio back in high school. It will set me up to have a nice outdoor job hopefully. It also appeases that conservationists/ecologist side of me that wants to save the planet.  </p>

<p> More uncharacteristic decisiveness: for a long time, I have been toying with the idea of going to the Naval Academy. For a week it will be all that I think about, and the next week I will be second guessing my service academy zeal. No longer. I’ve made my mind up. I’m doing it. Let’s kick this into gear. I can build a great application package. I have the physical attributes; I’m cultivating the leadership; I’ve got the 4.0. I know I can do this. </p>

<p> It’s really about the mindset. It’s so easy to be bogged down. It’s incredibly easy to let problem after problem swallow you up into a never ending pit of quick sand. Oh I’m not a good runner and not flexible and not good enough at math and- Just stop. It’s about the mindset. Maybe I’ve been watching too much Eric Bugenhagen on YouTube, but tenacity and perseverance never hurt. Being cynical has cost me too much already. It’s time to turn the frown upside down- so to speak. It’s a mindset. I think it’s important not to confuse mindset with motivation. Motivation is fleeting and comes and goes with the day, having the correct mindset will bring out the silver on grey days. </p>

<p> I want to cut down what I do to a manageable level. This means probably no more video editing, less radical redesigns of my blog, and a bunch of other things. </p>


<p> My studies- pretty self explanatory. I want to keep up the good academic work. Creativity- I want to read and write more. Recently I have been reading a book of short stories and loving it. My free time- I think free time is essential. Without it you burn out. I want to try and use my free time better. More volunteering, interning. I am looking into opportunities to become involved in environmental protection in CT! I want to spend less time on the people who do nothing for my life, more time on those who make me happy, more time on things that make me engaged, and more time on things which will build my raft. </p>

<p> Let’s talk fitness.  I’ll be doing my first powerlifting competition this July! I don’t care that I am woefully weak. It will be a good experience to have under my belt. Not to mention something to motivate me. I will be dropping 10lbs to get into the 93kg class. Still following the StepHep routine, but adding in way more reps than stated in the program. It’s a mindset goddamnit. I also will be adding in some running to prep for the USNA’s CFA. It should help my heart and challenge me in a new way. Too often do people get into these trenches where they do the same lifts for the same amount of reps. Adding in running and peaking for a meet should help to keep things fun. In a awful sort of way. </p>

<p> I have 20oz of light roast in me and I’ve got work to do. I’m hyped. </p>

<b>Life Stuff and Motivational Fluff</b>
<p class="tag2">April 15th, 2018.</p> 

<p> I have been reading and loving <i>The Power of Habits</i>. Great book. Inspiring and interesting and applicable all in one. When I finish I’ll be detailing my more complete thoughts. </p>

<p> A quick life update:</p> 

<p> The finish line is in sight. School ends in less than a month. I have an SAT retake looming. I’m still trying to squeeze every last drop of sour-time from life’s lemons. </p>

<p> Still plummeting towards 200lbs bodyweight. Still racing towards a 6-minute mile. Still reaching for my toes. A close squat grip in cahoots with excessive weekly pressing volume seem to have nibbled away at the edges of my elbow tendons. The inflexibility doesn’t help. Ice and band work seem to be reviving the joint. The pain is on the retreat. <br>
I have my first powerlifting meet in three months. </p>

<p> In my last update, I talked about focusing on four things. I lied. In reality I’ve been pouring myself into fitness, and academics, and not much else. My social life and free time have both suffered. This is okay. Life is about allocating resources. Perhaps a day will come when I will wish that I was more well-rounded during my freshman year of college. Perhaps not. </p>

<p> I just know that I have a goal in mind.<br> And if you aren’t chasing something, what are you doing? <br>
Don’t be content to let life pull you along. Don’t watch life go by episode after episode like some Netflix binge. Life isn’t great, but it has its moments, and they’re worth living. <br>
I don’t mean to sound like some bullshit motivational speaker when I say these things, but in a generation of aimlessness it might serve us well to pick up an instrument, book, ball, even a barbell. In an age where people are crippled with anxieties and distractions and social constructs larger than human evolutionary capacity, it might serve us well to chase something. It might serve us well to set our own course. </p>


<b> Cranium full of alphabet soup</b>
<p class="tag2">April 16th, 2018.</p> 

<p>
Lots of rambling tonight. This is a freezer for ideas I might want to develop later. You’ve been warned. 
</p>

<p>
The past can be like a pair of shoelaces. It can get knotted and lightheadedly tight. You’ll want to keep someone in your life, so you’ll double or triple knot them in. Knot after knot. Like scar tissue that scaffolds wounds or that cheap plywood in Home Depot. Sometimes its for nothing. Sometimes you’re left with blisters. Get new laces. And learn to not tie so tight. 
</p>

<p>
Notebooks are great. Buy one. Carry one. Use one. It doesn’t matter what kind. Honestly my head has never felt clearer. Say what you will about the digital revolution– nothing will replace a paper notebook. 
</p>

<p>
Still really enjoying my habit book. As I delve more into the science behind the human clockwork, I can’t help but see how disruptive phones can be. This year Samsung launched a phone without Wi-Fi or data in South Korea. Tempting. 
</p>

<center>
<p>
sun's pouring cream
<br>
across the horizon
<br>
looks like another
<br>
light and sweet,
<br>    
<i>morning</i>
</p>
</center>

<p>
I was looking back through old notebooks and saw this. It was scribbled on a napkin and taped to a page. I remember writing it at Donut Crazy and watching the sun rise over Stratford. 
</p>

<p>
Don’t give up before you’ve started. People always rationalize themselves out of chasing something. “I’m too tall to be a gymnast” “I don’t have the right insertions to be a bodybuilder” “I don’t have the legs to be a runner” “I don’t have enough fast twitch muscle tissue to be a sprinter.” Honestly. The people who never find their gifts are the ones who never try. I see It everywhere in the gym. It’s as if the fear of failure is sedating chunks of the population. It’s better to fail. I’d know.
</p>

<p>
Instant gratification. I was thinking about Instant gratification. Humans are gratification driven animals. So much of modern society exists to prey on this facet of our humanity. Think financing, Spotify premium, steroids. These exist to fill a niche in the market for quick gratification, whether it’s the new car, the song, or engorged muscle tissue. 
</p>

<p>
I’ve mentioned it in the past, but I want to eventually write at length about motivation v. discipline. This is something so many people have a warped perception of. Anecdotally: 
motivation is what I get after a good cup of coffee, discipline is what gets me out the door.
</p>  


<b> minimalism is not</b>
<p class="tag2">April 19th, 2018.</p>     

<p>Minimalism in the 21st century is a perversion of the artistic movement from which it takes its name. </p>

<p>
Online minimalism has created objective standards: <center>“Have you ditched your car?”<br> “Do you have more than 5 pieces of furniture?”<br> “Do you own more than 100 things?”<br> “Does your closet have more than 6 shirts?”<br> “Why do you own more than 3 books?”<br> “Why aren’t your rooms painted white?”<br><br></center> This contradicts the functionality of minimalism. Radical online standards of 3-piece wardrobes and bleak Scandinavian interiors have led to the destruction of function. Embracing this deindividualization is a one-way street from ‘too much’ to ‘too little.’ The idea that minimalism looks a certain way, that it can be copied like a recipe, is harmful.
</p>

<p>
Minimalism doesn’t replace consumerism– it changes the flavor. Self identifying ‘minimalists’ purchase ‘minimal’ products, and the free market is only too happy to supply. 
</p>

<p>
Online minimalism and its siren call of simplicity and happiness and Zen has led to an epidemic. Too many fall into the trap of using minimalism as medicine. Displacing their anxieties and conflicts onto their possessions. Reducing what they own instead of addressing their problems. 
</p>

<p>
Minimize friends, minimize food, minimize furniture, minimize fashion, minimize finances, and these are just the F’s. At a certain point you are no longer improving your life, you are gutting it. 
</p>

<p>
Minimalism is focusing your life, it’s an allocation of attention, It’s realizing the relativity of less. <br>
Minimalism isn’t a hashtag, it isn’t a style, it isn’t a number. 
</p>

<p class="tag2">April 26th, 2018.</p> 

<p>
 I’ve arrived.<br> A field of J. Crew models. White Mannequins. Boat shoes pointed out on waxed floor.  Leather wallets, heavy credit cards, attorney business cards. Nautical belts and chino. Smiles that curve like stock charts. Fathers check blackberries. Mothers take notes. 
    </p> 

<p>
I really am in Middletown.
</p>

<p>
We stand for the pledge.<br> It feels different. 
A girl with a blazer and a vanilla ice cream face is talking about asthma. Disqualifying.  There are Marines in tailored suits (extra room in chest and sleeve). There are refreshments. <i>Store brand– </i>  I hear a woman scoff. 

</p>

<p>
But how did I get here? Think back up rainy route 91. Think back over the day. The week. The year. Think of brick and glass. Think of that hot day wearing blue oxford and red graduation gown. How did I get here?

<b>summer’s doorstep</b>
<p class="tag2">May 1st, 2018.</p> 
<p>
Finally, a straightforward post. 
</p>

<p>
The semester is drawing to a close. I don’t believe it. My first year of college nearly over.  I can’t say that I am happy with all of it; can’t say that I am proud of all of it, but I’m doing better. Much better than high school. 
</p>

<p>
I hate downtime. Fortunately, it seems my summer is going to be anything but relaxing.
</p>

<p>
I won’t be doing anything <i>too</i> crazy. Some college students go on road trips, or try to live an idealized French lifestyle, or get lost in a jungle, or try to piece high school friendships back together. As fun as these all might sound, I’m determined to improve myself this summer. 
</p>



<p>
Over my vacation I will be migrating to a static Jekyll site. This will remove the pain usually associated with updating my blog. Right now to write an entry I have to: create a new html page, type the post in plaintext, copy the post into the page and add formatting, edit index.html to include a link to the new post. This is ridiculous. It’s backwards even by my standards. <br>
Creating a Jekyll theme will keep me working on (and updating) this blog. 
</p>

<p>
I’ll also be working. Most likely in a state park! Thanks to my campus job I am technically a state employee, a state employee who is transferring to the department of environmental protection for a seasonal job. It’ll be my sixth job. I’ve gone from construction worker to dishwasher to bakery assistant to barista to teller to Math Emporium assistant. What a wild ride its been. 
</p>

<p>
Besides my department of environmental protection job this summer I have a couple other commitments lined up. I’ll be teaching kids about endangered shore birds. I’ll also probably be spending a week or so living in the Vermont woods, working on the Long Trail.
</p>

<p>
I’m longing for those sunny days when I can bike to the beach, go for a walk, read in the sun, take the train somewhere, just soak up the world.
</p>

<p>
On the fitness front I’ve got a steep summer ahead. When school ends I’ll be joining a real gym and begin some real training for my first powerlifting meet. I’m excited to leave crunch behind. I hate not being able to use chalk. I hate the soft pop music. I hate middle-aged women who bounce on ellipticals, like discount fruit, and wrinkle their noses on every deadlift eccentric. I hate high school kids who squat >100 lbs with backs like parabolas and scream on every rep. 
<br> <br>That felt good to get out. <br> <br>
 I’ll be dieting down to around 200lbs and shooting for a 1100lbs total! I’m a little nervous of course, but it should be a good experience. <br>
I also have to begin training for the CFA, the standardized test for admittance into the United States Naval Academy. Once my powerlifting meet is over I will dial back the compounds and get my feet under me a little more. When I took the NROTC AFA, I was able to hit 80+ push-ups, a 6-minute mile, and nearly 100 sit-ups. Back then I weighed 170lbs, the bodyweight movements will definitely be a lot harder carrying 30+ more lbs. Still confident though. 
</p>



<p>
The strenuous process of applying to a service academy is deserving of it’s own post, but over the summer I’ll be assembling the pieces of my Navy application. 
</p>


<p>
I was also selected to become a peer mentor for my university! I have to attend a couple summer training sessions but that will be a good experience and leadership position for the books. For those who don’t know, a peer mentor is a guide of sorts for the freshman class. They’re implanted into freshman classes and form the initially connection between freshman and college. I’m actually quite excited.
</p>

<p>
College students spend a third of their time procrastinating. Americans average four hours a day on their phones. Scared yet? I’ve been reading “How to break up with your phone” and it has been turning me into something of a technophobe. But really, look around and one out of every two people you see under 30 will have their face buried in a phone. I’ve been trying to appreciate life a little more. Live in the present. Be more productive. All those clichés. 
</p>

<p>
It is also high time that I got my finances in order. Which means budgeting. At the start of college, I created an excel spreadsheet with about 900 cells and percentages to break down hourly wages, it had a file size of about 6mb, and was a terrible way to budget. Simple and effective is the way to go. Think Pareto's principle. Start with income, subtract expenses, allocate the rest. I’m aiming to build up my emergency fund again, put more into my IRA, get myself into a good place for college in the fall.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I will be prepping for my SAT, my third SAT. I have the second one in a week to set a benchmark, and will be prepping like mad after that. I’m aiming high, 1400-1500 at least.
</p>

<p>
What a wild summer it is going to be.

<b> hook grip</b>
<p class="tag2">May 1st, 2018.</p>   
<p>
I never imagined I would ever be concerned with the minutiae of barbell grips. <br> 
I’ve been acclimating myself to the thumb-wrenching hook grip. 
</p>

<p>
It is absolutely beautiful out today. I laid in the grass and studied history. It was the most peaceful I’ve felt in a long time. 
</p>

<p>
My afternoon consists of homework in a swanky coffee bar and the daily gym penance.

<p>
Zeno of Elea was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher of southern Italy. He is best known for his paradox describing motion to be impossible. Take any distance between two points, divide it in two, and always travel this halved distance. You will never reach your destination.

<b> all types of french presses</b>
<p class="tag2">May 9th, 2018.</p> 
<p>This morning I cracked my eyes with a French press coffee, and went to the gym where I was made to do the French press exercise. </p>


<p>
My teammates didn’t understand why I found that so interesting. 
It just got me thinking how the same words can hold different meanings to different people. The fluidity of language, perception is reality, all that stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
One French press tasted delicious, the other made me lose feeling in both shoulders.

<b> gym anniversary </b>
<p class="tag2">May 9th, 2018.</p>
<p> The last thing I could do right now is form coherent thoughts. But you, dear readers, should be used to that by now. </p>

<p> Today I switched gyms. My 1-year membership to Crunch Fitness expired. I guess it’s an anniversary of sorts. After a year: I’ve deadlifted 405, benched 275, and squatted 365. </p>

<p> My new gym is to crunch what the United States Army is to the Boy Scouts. </p>

<p> I went from a prince of the weight room, to the bottom of the barrel, a sardine in the Mariana trench. I’m also told what to lift, when, how much, all the details. I like that part. </p> 

<p> So today I was benching with T–, a guy who has three herniated discs, no surgery. Watching his face twist in agony on every rep didn’t feel too good in my stomach. He still lifted more than me though. </p>

<p> Long day. I ended up wandering the streets of Stratford, sore but too awake to sleep. It was dark except for pools of streetlight. I felt like a revenant, cursed to walk the pavement in search of rest. How poetic. Turns out I don’t sleep well in the heat. </p>

<b> changing tracks</b>
<p class="tag2">May 10th, 2018.</p> 
<p>
I survived finals week. Usually when people say that they <i>survived</i> something, it’s followed by a laugh, I’m not laughing. I lost 10 pounds. I went from a <del>robust</del> porky 215 to a linguine 203. </p>

<p> 
I realize that a lot of my recent posts, if you can call them that, have dealt with my never-ending and borderline obsessive quest for physical fitness. To keep things fresh, I’m going to mix things up a little today and talk about some other things that I have been up to.  
</p> 

<p>
I’ve been cooking!<br> I particularly like breakfast foods, waffles, pancakes, bacon, ham, eggs, even toast. A cup of coffee on the side to keep my caffeine habit in check and I have the makings of a great morning. 
</p>

<p>
Today for example I made a delicious breakfast sandwich. <br>
<p>
    Stephen's HEC
<br>    In a cast iron pan with medium-low heat.
<br>fry:
<br>two (2) eggs
<br>three (3) slices of ham
<br>chopped red pepper
<br>chopped onions
<br>
<br>Optionally you can add 2 strips of bacon or 1 sausage patty for some additional protein and flavor. 
<br><br>Make sure not to overcook the eggs, season with salt and pepper after you flip them, and add a slice of American cheese to each egg. 
<br><br> It’s delicious on Portuguese rolls, hard rolls, or a toasted bagel.

<b> how to break up with your phone</b>
<p class="tag2">May 16th, 2018.</p>    

<p>
I recommend that everyone read, <i>How to Break Up with Your Phone</i>, by Catherine Price. What an eye opening book. The average American consumer spends five (5!) hours a day on their phone. If that statistic doesn’t worry you, it should. </p>

<p>
Phone usage is linked to insomnia, stress, anxiety, depression, decreased attention span, decreased energy, decreased creativity, and much more. Excessive usage rewires your brain, and creates chemical imbalances. Not to mention the amount of productivity loss from constant notifications, or the cervical damage from constantly hunching over your phone, or the amount of money wasted on apps that are rarely used.
    </p>
    <p>
The problem is that phone usage is a subtle and widespread addiction. Without realizing it you may reach for your phone several hundred times a day. The world around us, the apps themselves, our own brain chemistry, all encourage this continual “grazing” on our phones. 
</p>
    <p>
Controlling your phone usage isn’t a silver bullet to reach nirvana, but in an evermore tired and depressed society, it may be what you need.
