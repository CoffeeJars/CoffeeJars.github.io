<h2>Week of Turning Points</h2>
    
<p>Monday:<br>
I ran out of gas in Middletown, and learned about inertia on the rolling hills. In Hartford, I interviewed for a job at the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP). During my evening workout, I squatted 365lbs for two easy reps, doubling my previous record. </p>
    
<p>Tuesday:<br>
I had my sutures removed. I’ll always have a scar above my left eye, a reminder to tie my shoes before farmer’s walks. I ate a decadent 1000+ calorie Cinnabon. My competition bench training was pain free, and I made delicious homemade cold brew coffee. </p>

<p>Wednesday:<br>
The day began with an awful deadlift session (it lacked caffeine and metal), and ended learning about healthy social interactions from telenovelas. I was offered a job at the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. </p>

<p>Thursday:<br>
Finally! I overhead pressed 185lbs. My CoC #1 gripper came in the mail. I can almost close it. I made this new blog layout. Bit of a slow, blue day. </p>
    
<p>Friday:<br>
Today I started work at CT DEEP. The building is old and beautiful, like a Manhattan transplant. I bought lunch from a food truck, ate in Bushnell park. 
</p>
    
<p>Saturday:<br>
I had a great training session: supinated rows, snatch grip rows, volume leg press. Played tennis. Splurged on sushi (in a physical and financial sense). Walked along the beach and discovered the only cactus native to Connecticut, The Eastern Prickly Pear (Opuntia humifusa). </p>

<p>Sunday:<br>
I caught up with some old friends who I hadn’t seen since high school. We had a great time. We went out for sushi (again) and screwed around in a local mall. It’s not what you do, its who you’re with. </p>
