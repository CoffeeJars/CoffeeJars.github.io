<p>Half Marathon</p>

<p>Here I am, about to run a half marathon. Still a powerlifter at this time. A thick 205lbs. Never having run farther than a mile in my life.</p>

<p>Only five minutes to go. The national anthem is played. We're all crowded up behind an inflatable arch with start spelled across in sans-serif white. </p>

<p> My younger brother is wrapping the cords of his headphones around his ears. I’m thinking about the differences between girls who run long distance, and girls who powerlift. </p>
<p>There are many. </p>


  <p>I only kept up with my brother for half a mile. In transmission terms I was in 5th and he was in 1st. He has promised to stick with me, but I waved him forward, and let the dry-fit crowd swallow him up.</p>

<p>The grey sky, which had hung so grey and full, finally broke open and hurled rain down to earth. My phone got wet, and broke. </p>

        <p>The rain sounds heavy. An old man who is bent nearly 90 degrees with age but runs with alacrity is saying, "you know I really expected GE to turn things around this quarter."</p> 

        <p>Running is so different from powerlifting. During my meet I was blank, my entire being was focused on the lifts, during my half marathon my mind is always wandering, my legs are out of focus, just two stumps of meat that bombard my brain with pain signals, and move sloppily beneath me, kicking up rain.</p>

        <p> I'm thinking of how well equipped humans are for endurance running, and yet how poorly adapted to this I seem to be. I'm thinking about all the fonts on all the sponsored shirts around me. I'm thinking about what this must look like from above, a rainbow snake slithering through an upscale suburban town, slowly coming apart as the group divides into smaller and smaller groups of runners. </p>

        <p> There are hills. Hills are worse. I slip further back, further into the snake of the race, I feel it crushing me, constricting my calves. </p>





     

        <p>Figures loom out of the rain in colorful L.L Bean raincoats, shouting encouragement, sometimes offering cups of water. My brother has instructed me to sip, not gulp. I don't know why, but I follow his advice. The water makes me feel better. I take a sip and pour the rest over my head, pointless since I'm already soaked to the bone. </p>    
 
        <p>Everyone runs with careful foot strikes, robotic, carrying out some programmed function, executing line after line of code, feeding themselves into the compiler of the race. I feel defective. </p>


        <p>We as humans create machines to do jobs, the purpose of our own body-machine was to survive long enough to reproduce, yet we create better and better machines to do tasks with tremendous efficiency and render ourselves obsolete, the function of our bodies becoming more pointless by the day as we delegate to inanimate hardware. And yet in a world where we strive to do less, here is a procession of runners pushing themselves to do more. There is something very human about a wounded gait. </p>    

        <p>My right calf has become a cement pillar, shoulder and side stab sporadically, my hamstrings feel like the end of a log being slowly lowered into a wood chipper. I am thinking frantically about all the types of injuries I could get. I'm hoping that when the injury comes, it's not serious, not a knee blowing out, not a hamstring pulling, not a piece of me falling out and bringing me crumbling to the ground like a Jenga tower. </p>

        <p> I must be close. We’re running along a seawall that keeps an iron sea at bay. The race had started at a beach. I must be close. An ambulance idles on the side of the road, waiting for someone like me to keel over. </p>

        <p> I really don’t know if I can make it. My legs are almost giving out on every footfall. My stride has become a limp-hop-trip-hobble type of choppy step. A woman runs by me, turns back to me, and says: “Come on pork chop.” </p>

        <p>I see it. The inflatable arch. the finish line. <p>

<p>I cross it.</p>
