        <div class="imgbox" style="width: 800px;">
            <img style="width: 100%;" src="site.png">
            <text class='caption'>Site as of Dec 2020. Note! the terrible quality in this image when compared with the one on the homepage is likely due to this one resulting from a screenshot, while that one a photo. The process I follow in gimp to make these seems more destructive on screenshots. Perhaps it is due to this screenshot being of a very white website, while the photo was in a dark room on a cellphone camera? Or the amount of pixels involved in each image file?</text>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <h1>Site notes</h1>
            <p>Probably about 1% done with this page. You have been warned.</p>
            <h2>Fonts?</h2>
            <p>Charter as it was a recommendation I had known about for a long time and is supposed to be good on low res screens. Also, roboto. Since I needed a nicer sans-serif font than arial. 
            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <p>To be described in future: why have a site? why this style? why not use wordpress?</p>
            <p>So so much to write out here that I will just use some raw <code>li</code>.</p>
            <h2>How I make the site images</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>animate the images? dots move and grow? </li>
                <li>get whatever image I want to convert into GIMP</li>
                <li>Image -> mode -> greyscale</li>
                <li>Colors -> Levels -> Set output in range [180,220] to wash the photo out. A higher number will wash the photo out more, resulting in more white and fewer dots in the final image.</li>
                <li>Image -> mode -> Indexed. With settings: 1-bit palette / Color dithering: Floyd-Steinberg (normal)</li>
                <li>Image -> Mode -> RGB</li>
                <li>Paint bucket tool to fill in white bg the offwhite <code>#f6e8e5</code> of the site.</li>
                <li>Save as png into site folder</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Right now this is all very WIP. So I have collected a list of improvements and iterations I would like to do.</p>
            <h2>Improvements & Ideas</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Improve process for making photos (python script?) / deterministic quality</li>
                <li>compress images / fonts to speed up loads (we are already blazing fast lol)</li>
                <li>Change fonts from px to em/rem?</li>
                <li>Improve the color? Is it websafe? I have two monitors and it looks different on each and it looks different still on my phone. Might want to change.</li>
                <li>Speaking of phones, improve mobile support? Already included in the simplicity of the site?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I am going to attempt to do a page split. Where I can slot another piece of content into the right hand or center of screen.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="imgbox"><!-- no custom width this time!-->
            <img style="width: 100%;" src="me.png">
            <text class='caption'>Me again, testing the page split.....</text>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <h1>Continuing on,</h1>
            <p>Here we are again in <code>col</code>.</p>
            <p>using only the <code>col</code> and <code>imgbox</code> classes I can really really easily maintain a 2 column, relatively mobile friendly, page setup. </p>
            <p>Whenever we want to insert a photo into the left column we type some code like:</p>
          
        </div>

    </body>
</html>
