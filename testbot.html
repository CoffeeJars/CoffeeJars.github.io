        <p>As if paying <a href="https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-news-uconn-tuition-increase-20191211-vfccyhknmrgdrdc52wtse3vo2e-story.html"target="_blank">ever increasing</a> tuition was not enough, the UConn bookstore has taken it upon itself to spam each and every student with <i>deals</i>.</p>
        <p>Here are some of those <i>deals</i> in an array: </p>
        <div class="code">
        <pre>
deals = ["Microsoft Office 2019 only $39.95 | Adobe & more.",
		"Shop 2019 holiday ornaments before they're gone‚Ä¶",
		"Savings, Savings, & Savings for YOU!",

        <p>I wrote a very simple python bot using the <a href="https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"target="_blank">praw</a> (Python Reddit API Wrapper) library, so that these unbeatable <i>deals</i> could be better shared with the student body!</p>
