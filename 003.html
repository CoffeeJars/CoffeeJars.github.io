<p class="title">Snow Day</p>    
    
<p>Didn’t go to the gym. Didn’t clean my room. Didn’t get any homework done. Didn’t go anywhere. So why am I still happy with today? <br>
Let me tell you.<br> I have been meandering around the idea of trying to crack my way into the United States Naval Academy, and today I decided I was going to do it. This is a big deal. Now I know which direction to go in, and what I have to do. Not only that! I’ve decided I want to be an English major. I love language, and books, and reading, and just all of it. </p>

<p>This just means that I will be running a bit more, shooting for at least one powerlifting meet, and maybe retaking the SATs. </p>

<p>It’s an exciting road ahead, but now it’s time for bed. </p>


<p> The boat is launched, let's chase the horizon.</p>
