      <h2>Mar 9</h2>
        <p>
        Don't judge me. I read 1,744 pages of YA literature for most of the early morning hours of march 9th. I am very ashamed to admit it but I read the entire original series of Percy Jackson.

        <p>It's westrock, right in that Woodbridge, New Haven, Hamden area. Right where I am going to school right now, in all of it's unspoiled beauty. Also annoyingly google photos does not make it easy to embed media. Ugh.</p>

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2744513950">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Solid advice to be taken with a heavy dose of skepticism. <br />Rippetoe brings a "one-size-fits-all" approach to fitness, simplifying a complex and personalized procedure into a shopping list of sets and reps.
