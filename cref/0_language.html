      <h1>Comments, Directives, Statements, Expressions</h1>
      
      <p>All the textual elements you may find inside a <code>.c</code> source file. </p>
      
      <h2>Comments</h2>
      <p>You spend more time reading your code than the computer
      does. Leave concise and helpful comments. Old comments can be
      misleading, so prune back irrelevant or unnecessary ones. </p>
<code><pre>
/* Between the "slash star" and the "star slash" is a comment in c. */
// From C99 onward you can do a line comment with a double slash.
</code></pre>
      <p>Rob Pike in <a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/pikestyle" target="_blank">Notes on Programming in C</a>: <i>"...keep comments brief and
	banner-free. Say what you want to say in the program, neatly and
	  consistently. Then move on."</i></p>
	      
      <p><a href="https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/~mccann/styletemplatesCP.html"
	    target="_blank">Prof. McCann</a> argues: <i>" It has been
	  estimated that about 70% of programming effort is put into
	  the maintenance of old code ... Commenting exists to help
	  those unfortunate programmers who have to look at the code
	  months or years after it was written."</i></p>
      <p>Strike a healthy balance between over and under
	commenting. Comments are not checked by the compiler, meaning they can
	lie to you. However, well written and purpose-describing
	comments can make debugging, maintaining, replacing code easier.</p>

      <h2>Directives</h2>
      <p>A directive is a command given to the preprocessor. During
	the first stage of <a href="../cref/1_compilation.html"
	target="_blank">compilation</a> a program called the
	preprocessor will read the <code>.c</code> source file and:
	preprocessor is the program running during the first step of
	compilation, a program (the preprocessor) reads the source
	file and does several simple prep steps: Joining lines that
	continue with \. <p>
<code><pre>
#include &#60;stdio.h&#62;
