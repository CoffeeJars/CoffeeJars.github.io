The goal is to synthesize together a high quality and extensive source
on C programming.  Complete with good code examples which I can reuse.
Books I own in paper: * C in plain english - good for conversational
tone * K&r - complete the code as examples * POSIX threads - this
would be really painful im sure * developers guide to debugging -
could be useful to add gdb info / prof / cov I will supplement these
with LDM's material, online resources, handmade hero, etc!  Even
incorporate material from senior design, and os, and comparch classes
The most important part is collecting together the material and
writing, I can always cut down or reformat later!
