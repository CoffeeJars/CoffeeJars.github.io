<p class="title">A minimal complaint on minimalism</p>    

<p>Minimalism in the 21st century is a perversion of the artistic movement from which it takes its name. </p>

<p>
Online minimalism has created objective standards: <center>“Have you ditched your car?”<br> “Do you have more than 5 pieces of furniture?”<br> “Do you own more than 100 things?”<br> “Does your closet have more than 6 shirts?”<br> “Why do you own more than 3 books?”<br> “Why aren’t your rooms painted white?”<br><br></center> This contradicts the functionality of minimalism. Radical online standards of 3-piece wardrobes and bleak Scandinavian interiors have led to the destruction of function. Embracing this deindividualization is a one-way street from ‘too much’ to ‘too little.’ The idea that minimalism looks a certain way, that it can be copied like a recipe, is harmful.
</p>

<p>
Minimalism doesn’t replace consumerism– it changes the flavor. Self identifying ‘minimalists’ purchase ‘minimal’ products, and the free market is only too happy to supply. 
</p>

<p>
Online minimalism and its siren call of simplicity and happiness and Zen has led to an epidemic. Too many fall into the trap of using minimalism as medicine. Displacing their anxieties and conflicts onto their possessions. Reducing what they own instead of addressing their problems. 
</p>

<p>
Minimize friends, minimize food, minimize furniture, minimize fashion, minimize finances, and these are just the F’s. At a certain point you are no longer improving your life, you are gutting it. 
</p>

<p>
Minimalism is focusing your life, it’s an allocation of attention, It’s realizing the relativity of less. <br>
Minimalism isn’t a hashtag, it isn’t a style, it isn’t a number. 
</p>
