<p class="title">how to break up with your phone
</p>    


<p>
I recommend that everyone read, <i>How to Break Up with Your Phone</i>, by Catherine Price. What an eye opening book. The average American consumer spends five (5!) hours a day on their phone. If that statistic doesn’t worry you, it should. </p>

<p>
Phone usage is linked to insomnia, stress, anxiety, depression, decreased attention span, decreased energy, decreased creativity, and much more. Excessive usage rewires your brain, and creates chemical imbalances. Not to mention the amount of productivity loss from constant notifications, or the cervical damage from constantly hunching over your phone, or the amount of money wasted on apps that are rarely used.
    </p>
    <p>
The problem is that phone usage is a subtle and widespread addiction. Without realizing it you may reach for your phone several hundred times a day. The world around us, the apps themselves, our own brain chemistry, all encourage this continual “grazing” on our phones. 
</p>
    <p>
Controlling your phone usage isn’t a silver bullet to reach nirvana, but in an evermore tired and depressed society, it may be what you need.
