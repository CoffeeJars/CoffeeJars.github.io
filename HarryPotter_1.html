    <h2>Harry Potter #1</h2>
        <p> The Harry Potter books were a constant companion for me throughout elementary school. I have a vivid memory of Mr. Tibor, my fifth grade teacher, hurling my copy of Prisoner of Azkaban out an upstairs window to get me to pay attention in class. I decided that this summer, heading into my sophomore year of college, I would reread the series. </p>
        <p> So far I’ve chewed through the first three books, and come up with enough observations to catalogue some of them here. </p>
        <p> There will be spoilers, but c’mon, </p>
        <ol>
            <li> It’s Harry Potter, everyone’s read it </li>
            <li> It was released in 1997</li>
        </ol>
    <h3> Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone </h3>
        <p> The idea that a downtrodden kid who sleeps under the stairs could escape his awful family life, make friends, and have adventures, is incredibly appealing to young readers. The whole experience is analogous to what we the reader do: escaping into the world of the books to befriend the characters, and go with them on adventures. </p> 
        <p> The concept is appealing, but book one is terrible. Easily the worst of the series. Unquestionably bad. </p>
        <p> The writing tries too damn hard and lacks the fluidity of later books, the plot stumbles and bumps forward like a goddamn freight train, characters are clunky and robotic, no humor, no chemistry. </p>
        <p> One aspect of the book I do like is the subversion of the obvious bad guy trope. Harry is 11 in this book and his simplistic understanding of good and bad, where he leaps to the conclusion that Snape is clearly the antagonist, is a perfect reflection of his perspective and of the perspective of young readers. The villain just <b>has</b> to be that mean teacher who asks unreasonable questions, plays favorites, and takes points. But this isn’t the case. The true villain turns out to be the stuttering and unassuming defense professor. The fact that Harry (and you the reader) jump to the conclusion of Snape’s guilt, teaches a lesson about appearances and assumptions. </p>
        <p> Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a necessary evil, It’s the awkward first date in what will become an amazing relationship. You drop the butter on the floor, spill water on yourself, your card gets declined, and you go in for a kiss after some garlicky oily linguine, but something about your stammered apologies and tomato-red face makes her laugh, and agree to a second date. </p>
    <h3> Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets </h3>
        <p> The second book is just hands down better. </p>
        <p> I really love the start of the Chamber of Secrets, the uncomfortable realization that his friends haven’t made any attempt at communication, and the perpetual misery of the Dursley’s make for a great start. This does two things: First it once again makes us empathize with Harry, the characters which we invested ourselves in throughout the first book have abandoned not only Harry, but us too. This is something which JK does well, making the reader feel what Harry is feeling, which further connects us to him. Secondly, Harry’s annual return to the muggle world creates an excellent starting location for the books, and forms a dichotomy between the muggle and magical worlds. It grounds Hogwarts in reality, impressing upon readers that this takes place in <b>our</b> world, not some high fantasy realm with a polysyllabic name. By reminding readers of this, it builds more bridges between our lives and experiences and the contents of the book, drawing us in deeper. </p>
        <p> This book also has <b>humor</b>, thank god! I am so happy that some editor probably held JK at gun point and told her to make her magic books funny. By adding in humor, the books become more fun to read, and a better reflection of the human experience. There are so many funny bits in book two, Lockhart’s lessons and idiocy, Ron’s ward and it’s many screw-ups, Colin Creevey and his incessant pestering, Wood and his Quidditch obsession. </p>
        <p> The book also cuts some of the unfunny humor, some of the dumber Fred/George bits, and the stupid school song. </p>
        <p> Even better than the humor, is the balance. The second book is noticeably darker than the first, attacks all over school, a student body who is afraid and resentful towards Harry, and yet this gloom is balanced out with the addition of humor. The book is a remarkable improvement over the first because paradoxically it managed to get darker and lighter simultaneously. The net effect of which is a book with more depth. </p> 
        <p> This movement towards depth and complexity parallels the growth of both Harry and the reader. As I grew older and my emotional spectrum expanded, and the Harry Potter books widened right along with it. I think this is possibly the most important aspect of the series: Harry’s growth is as much a story about you the reader as it is about him. </p> 
        <p> In terms of plot, a pattern begins to emerge which will remain constant throughout the entire series. </p>
        <p> Dursley’s -> Hogwarts -> A problem -> The gang works to solve the problem -> Clues point to obvious bad guy -> Climax with dramatic plot twist -> train home and wrap up. </p>  
        <p> This is the structure of every single Harry Potter book. Book two is no exception. Every book has the classic bait and switch, where a character that the trio (and you) assumed was good turns out to be the antagonist. Quirrell, Ginny, Peter Pettigrew, etc etc. </p>
        <p> Personally this did not detract from the series for me. The problems are diverse, and the world rich enough to make every year seem like a whole new experience. Many books that feature mysteries and plot twists are absolutely terrible re-reads, Harry Potter on the other hand is an amazing re-read. JK preserves this enjoyment by leaving all kinds of subtle hints and clues throughout the story, which were overshadowed in your initial reading, but which you will notice when returning. In book two this comes in the form of Ginny’s downward spiral, the Gryffindor culprit of the diary, Hagrid’s mention of Ginny being around the grounds (to strangle chickens) and on and on. These little hints don’t pop out on initial readings, and are actively shrouded from the reader (as seen in Ron’s insistence that Ginny is sad about the attack on Mrs. Norris because she is a cat lover, etc). </p>
    <h3> Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban </h3>
        <p> The books just keep getting better and better. Little by little JK has added meat and substance to the skeleton of book one, and in the third book, it staggers into life. </p>
        <p> The third book makes <b>huge</b> strides in developing the characters. The third book is amazing because so much boils over, so much is developed, so much is learned about Harry and his friends. We see Hermione, the know-it-all and stellar student, crack under the pressure of her classes. We see the relationship between Ron and Hermione split along the seam of their differences in such real and organic ways. </p>
        <p> To continue my analogy from before, the third book is that exciting relationship phase where you get to know someone. In the Prisoner of Azkaban, you really begin to get to know these characters, to meet them, not just to read about them. </p>
        <p> I keep bringing it up, but Harry Potters biggest strength is in how it connects to the reader’s own life. We see a 13-year-old Harry and his angsty friends, with a world which is starting to expand outside of the school boundaries. I’ve read interpretations of other readers, arguing that the dementors in book three represent the characters falling into a depression, so typical for hormonally-imbalanced teens. While I’m not sure I totally agree, it sounds good, and fits with my narrative about Harry’s life mirroring your own as a reader. </p>
        <p> On a more textual level, the third book does a great job of using its internal structures to build the world. Lupin’s defense against the dark arts classes deal with the various magical animals, most of which will come up again in later books. I think this is a great way to help build a world, and helps the narrative considerably in following books, as seen in Mrs. Weasley’s breakdown in book 6, the second task in book 4, and more. The second and third books make great use of classroom time to help carry the story. In book two, DADA classes were a comedic relief. In book three, DADA classes help to flesh out the universe of the magical world. Compare this to the absolute lack of description of any classes in book 1, wasted potential. </p>
        <p> Sirius black goes from one of the most hated characters to one of the most loved characters in the span of 50 pages. I had an unshakable mental image of “JK Rowling’s instant good-guy mix, just add water!” It’s interesting to analyze the ways in which Black grows on the hearts. He gives gifts to both Harry and Ron, a broomstick and an owl respectively. He shows courage to hold off Lupin, and he says nice things about Harry’s parents (which we all know is the way to Harry’s heart). After Pettigrew is returned to human form, Sirius compares nicely to the ratty and groveling man. </p>
        <p> Something noticeably good about book three is how JK avoids making Sirius feel retconned in. We’re three books deep into the series, throwing a majorly important character into the mix now is off-putting to say the least. Except Sirius was mentioned in the second chapter of the first book, his photo appears in the Harry’s photo album, and his arrival into the story is aided by the catalyst of Scabbers (Peter Pettigrew) who had been in the story since the first train ride to Hogwarts. All these factors make him feel less like a new character, and more like one who was just off screen. </p>
        <p> Finally, the third book does a good job of introducing objects to help carry the story in future books. The owl that Sirius gives to Ron provides the possibility of contact over the summers between the two of them. The Marauder’s map (in tandem with the invisibility cloak) helps Harry & co. navigate the school and avoid expulsion on their adventures, allowing for the events in later books to transpire. </p>
