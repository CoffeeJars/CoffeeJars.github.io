<p class="title">pulled plug</p>    
<p> I’ll be dashing to the gym in half an hour so this should be a quick post. <br>
I’ve decided that from now until Monday morning (3/26/18), I'll be cutting down on the phone use.<br> Just as a break. To enjoy the present a little more. To stop worrying over silly things.  </p>
<p> I think it will be good for me. </p>

<p> Thoughts: <br>
“We are a school of small spoons in a big cutlery drawer” <br>
“You don't know your real friends until they tell you they won't help you return the ti89 titanium graphing calculator that you bought from target” <br>
I need to transfer. Perhaps not to the Naval Academy? <br>
I’m going to replay half-life tonight I think. <br>
Wizard people, dear reader is great, so is Freeman’s mind <br>
I really need to learn how to use commas huh. That would help things. <br>
Still need to finish Productivity Project + make a book page <br>
So tired of so many people. <br>
I am going to join the book club. </p>

<p>Oh this post is so... sandpaper, a cat's tongue, turf on a cold night, a dry throat, oak tree bark, roofing shingles, bristles across a cheek, OSB Plywood, rough. Whatever.
