<p class="title">the middletown experience </p>    

<p>
 I’ve arrived.<br> A field of J. Crew models. White Mannequins. Boat shoes pointed out on waxed floor.  Leather wallets, heavy credit cards, attorney business cards. Nautical belts and chino. Smiles that curve like stock charts. Fathers check blackberries. Mothers take notes. 
    </p> 
    
<p>
I really am in Middletown.
</p>
    
<p>
We stand for the pledge.<br> It feels different. 
A girl with a blazer and a vanilla ice cream face is talking about asthma. Disqualifying.  There are Marines in tailored suits (extra room in chest and sleeve). There are refreshments. <i>Store brand– </i>  I hear a woman scoff. 
 
</p>

<p>
But how did I get here? Think back up rainy route 91. Think back over the day. The week. The year. Think of brick and glass. Think of that hot day wearing blue oxford and red graduation gown. How did I get here?
