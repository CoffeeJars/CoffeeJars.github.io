<p class="week">24/52</p>
<p> Monday: <br> First 8 hour day of work. Checked out a lovely Café for my boss. Smashed my hand at the gym under a 45lbs plate. Miserable. Pain. Throbbing. Took a nice cocktail of melatonin and pain killers and then tossed and turned for the whole night. </p>
 
<p> Tuesday: <br> Miserable at work. Couldn’t bent my finger. Couldn’t focus. Slept terribly. Nearly passed out at the wheel while driving. Left work early and skipped the gym. Went to my volunteer position though with the fish and wildlife service. The mystery of KBT. Installed a camera. When I went home I had finally had enough. I asked my dad to help put me out of my misery and with a drill bit we made a hole in the middle of my nail and let the blood out. Instant relief. </p>
 
<p> Wednesday: <br> Another full day at work. Gym was really shitty though. No one really likes me there blah blah incessant whining on my part whatever. I need to try and bounce back and enjoy the enviorment. Doing rows on the deadlift bar was a cardinal sin apparently. </p>
 
<p> Thursday: <br> Work again. Rushed through the gym session. Everything felt tough. Still dialing in my deadlift form. Sometimes it feels really good and sometimes it doesn’t. oh well. I went to a graduation, that was fun, I also got buffalo wild wings, and died from the Mango Habenaro. Every time that I deadlift blood starts oozing from my finger like an active volcano. Grip strength still not there. </p>
 
<p> Friday: <br> Had coffee for like the second time this week and felt instantly better. I love harry potter, listening to the audiobooks in the morning is an amazing way to start the day. I was thinking about how much better of a book the second HP is vs the first one. The second one has HUMOR which is something that the first one sorely lacked. The first one has some lame tongue in cheek humor</p>

<p> Saturday: <br>
Ran around a bunch. Went thrift shopping and bought a hideously amazing sweater made from alpaca wool. Took a jaunt through a fancy Westport gardening store and wished that the Connecticut climate could grow coffee trees. </p>

<p> Sunday: <br>
Lazy day. Went to the local gym (not my hardcore powerlifting gym) and noticed the huge difference in environment. Messed around. Did snatches, rack pulls, silly stuff.  </p>


<p> I am happy to say that I have a new job. I was going crazy not working. I’m based in this beautiful Hartford office building, where I work in the records center. It’s a lot of filing, lots of alphabetizing, but I don’t mind. I’ve had worse jobs. Since my 16th birthday I have done construction, washed dishes, decorated cakes, delivered Chinese food, worked as a barista, and a teller, and even for my university. I’ve had a lot of jobs. </p>


<p> You might have noticed that the design of my blog has once again changed. I can safely say that this will be the final iteration. I want to take a minute to lay out some of my thoughts on blogging and design. </p>
<p> The obvious question, “why update a blog in the first place?” Well, it takes a certain kind of person. I don’t do it for money. I am under no delusions that enough of an audience would ever want to read my fragmented sentences, or keep up to date with my life, injuries, job, worries, training, reading, etc. </p>
<p>I blog because I enjoy it. </p>
<p> I love writing; I love making webpages. Blogging hits that perfect overlap in the Venn diagram. </p> 

<p> I wanted this website to be a safe haven, a shelter, a pirates’ cove for the written word. These days’ language has taken a back seat, hidden behind videos and pictures and audio and god knows what else. There is a quiet beauty in words. The mystery of language. Reading isn’t like watching a video, you don’t have information chewed up and spit back out for you. When you read you play the diver, in a reef of coral words, you play the archeologist dusting off sentences and phrases, labeling them carefully, subject verb article noun. Reading is hacking through a jungle, carving a path from intro to conclusion. </p>

<p> I wanted this to somehow be reflected on my site. To place the written word above all else. This is why my blog is text only. </p>

<p class="week">week 23/52</p>    
   
<p>Monday:<br>
I ran out of gas in Middletown, and learned about inertia on the rolling hills. In Hartford, I interviewed for a job at the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP). During my evening workout, I squatted 365lbs for two easy reps, doubling my previous record. </p>
    
<p>Tuesday:<br>
I had my sutures removed. I’ll always have a scar above my left eye, a reminder to tie my shoes before farmer’s walks. I ate a decadent 1000+ calorie Cinnabon. My competition bench training was pain free, and I made delicious homemade cold brew coffee. </p>

<p>Wednesday:<br>
The day began with an awful deadlift session (it lacked caffeine and metal), and ended learning about healthy social interactions from telenovelas. I was offered a job at the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. </p>

<p>Thursday:<br>
Finally! I overhead pressed 185lbs. My CoC #1 gripper came in the mail. I can almost close it. I made this new blog layout. Bit of a slow, blue day. </p>
    
<p>Friday:<br>
Today I started work at CT DEEP. The building is old and beautiful, like a Manhattan transplant. I bought lunch from a food truck, ate in Bushnell park. 
</p>
    
<p>Saturday:<br>
I had a great training session: supinated rows, snatch grip rows, volume leg press. Played tennis. Splurged on sushi (in a physical and financial sense). Walked along the beach and discovered the only cactus native to Connecticut, The Eastern Prickly Pear (Opuntia humifusa). </p>

<p>Sunday:<br>
I caught up with some old friends who I hadn’t seen since high school. We had a great time. We went out for sushi (again) and screwed around in a local mall. It’s not what you do, its who you’re with. </p>
