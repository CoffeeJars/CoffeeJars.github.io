    <h1>CT Summer Showdown</h1>
        <p> On July 21st, I competed in my first ever Powerlifting meet. </p>
    <h2> warm up</h2>
        <p>I had to weigh in at 205 pounds to make weight for the 93kg class. </p>
        <p> Unfortunately, the day before the meet, my scale was still reading 210. Oh no. I shot a text to my friend Ayla, who knows more about powerlifting than I ever will, and she outlined a crash diet for me. It worked, too well. When I weighed in the next day, I was only 200. </p>     
        <p> In the first of many mistakes, I only brought two PB&J sandwiches to eat after weighing in. Which turns out, is not enough to fully offset the metabolic damage that I had done to myself the previous day. <p>
        <p>Worse still, my face, neck, and left arm were covered in eruptions of poison ivy. I itched terribly, and looked dreadful. I looked like a sort of plague victim, who had chosen to lift in a Powerlifting meet through the make-a-wish foundation. </p>
    <h2> Squat </h2>
        <p> When I say that this powerlifting meet was an educational experience I mean that in so many ways. Here’s one: I started off completely embarrassed by what I felt was an indecently short singlet. It was an Inzer singlet I had borrowed from the gym, a brand known to hug the upper thigh. I was so thrown off by this that I screwed up squatting the 45lbs bar during warm ups. A great way to start the meet. <p>
        <p> By the time I took my opener, I was over this, people had assured me it was fine. By the end of the meet, I liked the singlet so much that I ordered my own. </p>
        <p> My opening squat was 352.2lbs. An easy number. I had hit it for a triple a week prior. </p>
        <p>The gym had been split into two areas, a stage was separated from the warm-up area by a thin black curtain. I was in a disorganized line behind this curtain waiting to be called to the platform. <p>
        <p> My coach put chalk across my shoulders, he was saying something, but I couldn’t hear him over the metal I had blasting both my eardrums apart. I was called. I hurried out to the platform as quickly as I could. This walk, between the edge of the curtain and the waiting barbell was strange to me. I felt so uncomfortable walking to the barbell, but right at home when I started setting up. This is probably because all of my training revolves around squatting, and none of it revolves around a watching crowd. <p>
        <p> I take my squat grip, index fingers just outside the rings, a wide grip for my inflexible shoulder girdle. I have my Rouge belt nice and tight, I love the softness of the leather, I love the simplicity of a single prong belt, and I love the feeling of lifting with a belt on. For my first meet I am not wearing knee sleeves or wrist wraps, we’re going raw baby. </p>
        <p> One glaring fault in my powerlifting is my lack of a template, a total understanding of the lift to be repeated and perfected. All the best lifters always work from a template in their heads, a template of the lift grinded into the fibers of their body through repetition. For every one of their lifts, they take the same breathes, do the same cues, execute the lift the same way. I don’t have this. </p>
        <p> I squat easily. <p>
        <p> My next attempt is 380.3lbs. I hit that one easily too. It feels as though the deload has done some magic for my squat. I barely feel the weight, I feel fluid and powerful. </p>
        <p>The feeling of lifting in the meet was like nothing that I had ever felt before. Completely different from lifting in training. My eyes were open, but I couldn’t see in front of me. My thoughts were racing, but my mind was blank. Music was blasting, but I was deaf. It was such an intense and obsessive focus, the likes of which I had never felt before. It was like in that moment I existed just to lift a barbell.</p>
        <p> Before my final squat, 402.3lbs, I gulp some electrolyte water. Disgusting stuff honestly, tangy, metallic, Gatorade-y, gross. I picked up a bottle at Rite-Aid and am deeply regretting it. </p>
        <p> 402 flies up and I get three more white lights. 3/3 so far! </p>
    <h2> Bench </h2>
        <p> I hate benching. I hate bench press with my entire being. Undoubtedly because I am bad at it. My arms are too long, my arch is not even an arch, I have absolutely no leg drive, I have no strength off the chest, and I have a lot of difficulty stacking the wrist, forearm, and elbow to ensure good leverage. Did I mention I hate benching? </p>
        <p> The back room is crammed with lifters; I’m sharing the bench with at least 4 other guys. In between each warmup we have to adjust the weight, and change rack heights, and wait for the next guy to go through his 30 second set up which looks like the construction of a suspension bridge. My warm up gets rushed. </p>
        <p> My opener, 242.5 lbs, and my second attempt, 264.6 lbs both go up without trouble. Out of all the lifts, my crash diet seems to have effected my bench the most. It doesn’t feel great. </p>
        <p> My third attempt of 270.1 is where it all falls apart. The center could not hold. After the press command I get the bar an inch up, maybe two, and it stops dead. I struggle with it, but it doesn’t budge. The spotters grab it. Three red lights. </p>
        <p> I’m not too bothered; it only confirms the deep rooted hatred that I have for benching. I also have the type of personality that can let things go and move on to the next hurdle. I focus on deadlifting. </p>
    <h2> Deadlift </h2>
        <p> The final stretch! I drank some water, and took the shirt off that I had been wearing under my singlet. My friend Ryan even gave me some of his rice cakes. Those things are delicious. My coach put baby powder on my legs to help the bar slide up. All around I was feeling pretty good. </p>
        <p> My opener of 380 flew up, my second attempt of 413 flew up too. </p>
        <p> I had underestimated how long meets actually take. 3 attempts at 3 lifts, each attempt taking one minute, 9 minutes per person, 17 or so people competing, should be around 2 hours right? Wrong. Try 5. </p>
        <p> The good thing was that besides my gnawing hunger, the time was flying by. Everyone was amazing. All the people who I had trained with had showed up, and were screaming encouragement during the lifts. It was as if the atmosphere was electric. Lots of fist bumps and back claps and hugs all around. </p>
        <p> Let’s give some shout outs. My buddy Grant was there, who frequently uses polysyllabic strength and conditioning terms, my nutritionist pal Kelly was announcing, my go-to person for anything food related, Ayla was there, probably the strongest girl that I have ever met, who also was the one to push me to sign up for this meet, Luke was there, the guy has a badass beard and awesome lifts. Another pal Ryan was competing along with me, even Tim, a strongman with strength a couple of exponents higher than mine was there. </p>
        <p> It was time for my final lift. A 429.9lbs deadlift. Like they had promised, my song came on, Meddler by August burns red. If anything will get you fired up for a big lift, metal will. It was an easy lift. I barely felt the bar in my hands. Three white lights. </p>
        <p> The thing about powerlifting is that by and large the meet is a forgone conclusion. The real powerlifting experience is the daily grind, getting strong bit by bit, learning new techniques and movements and protocols to help training, meeting people along the way, meeting people to scream and cheer for you when you lift. Powerlifting is a journey, not a destination. I think there’s something very beautiful about that. </p>
