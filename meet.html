<h1>My First Powerlifting Meet</h1>
    
<p> On July 21st, I competed in my first ever Powerlifting meet. The complete results can be seen <a href="http://usapl.liftingdatabase.com/competitions-view?id=2122">here!</a> It was truly an amazing experience. I am so glad I signed up, trained, and did it. 
</p>



<h3 id="subtopic1"> Lead up
</h3>



<p>I had to weigh in at 205lbs to make weight for the 93kg class. 
Unfortunately, the day before the meet, my scale was still reading 210. Oh no. I texted my friend Ayla, who knows more about powerlifting than I ever will, and she wrote out a diet plan for me. It worked, too well perhaps. When I weighed in the next day, I was only 200lbs. 
</p>



<p> Furthermore, I had brought two PB&J sandwiches to eat after weighing in, to recover my strength for lifting, but had no idea that the meet would last 5 hours. By the time I took the platform for my third deadlift attempt, my stomach was growling audibly and the only thing I wanted to lift was food into my mouth. It didn’t help that the staff was biting into mouth-watering sandwiches from House of Bones BBQ. 
 </p>



<p>Worse still, my face, neck, and left arm were covered in eruptions of poison ivy. I itched terribly, and looked dreadful with the raised red lumps across my face. I looked like a sort of plague victim, who had chosen to lift in a Powerlifting meet through the make-a-wish foundation.
</p>



<p>I also hate the taste of electrolyte water. Tangy, metallic, Gatorade-y, gross. I picked up a bottle at Rite-Aid and barely gulped it down after weigh ins. 
</p>



<p>Things didn’t get much better after weigh ins. I failed squatting the 45lbs bar in the warm up room because I was so distracted by my extremely short singlet. It took me the majority of my squat warm up to become “okay” with the length of the thing. 
</p>



<h3 id="subtopic2"> Tunnel vision

</h3>



<p>The feeling of lifting in the meet was like nothing that I had ever felt before. My eyes were open, but I couldn’t see in front of me. My thoughts were racing, but my mind was blank. Music was blasting, but I was deaf. It was such an intense and obsessive focus, the likes of which I had never felt before. It was like in that moment I existed just to lift a barbell. 
 </p>



<p> Everything around me would fade. It was a wonderful and bizarre thing. </p>



    
<h3 id="subtopic2"> The people
</h3>    
    
<p>Everyone was amazing. Everyone from my gym who showed up to watch or compete at the gym were just, so amazing. Everyone was supportive and positive, many fist bumps and back claps and words of encouragement were had. 
</p>    
  
    
<p>It was hands down the most positive atmosphere I had ever been in. A mix of serious competition, and friendly comradery. 
</p>
    
    
    <h3 id="subtopic2"> Reflection </h3>

    <p>I learned so much from my first me. Mostly what not to do. Armed with this knowledge, I can’t wait to get stronger, and stomp across that platform again.
