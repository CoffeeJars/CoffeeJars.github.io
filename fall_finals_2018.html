  <h1>Fall Finals 2018</h1>
  <p><b>The Goal- </b><br>Straight A's for the fall 2018 semester. </p>
  <p><b>Update 1- </b><br>Today is Friday, November 30th, 2018. I am writing this in the deserted third floor of the Buley Library. It is 3:57pm.</p>
  <p>The first step is to complete all my unfinished homework for the remainder of the term. With this out of the way, I can focus my sole attention on preparing for finals.</p>
  <p><b>The Aforementioned Unfinished Homework-</b>
    <ul>
      <li>INQ 391 - Portfolio Binder </li>
      <li>INQ 391 - Final Reflection Essay</li>
      <li>MAT 122 - Online Practice Problems</li>
      <li>CHE 120 - Lab Report</li>
    </ul>
  </p>


  <p><b>Update 2- </b><br>
    Today is Saturday, the first of December, 2018. It's exactly 8:30pm. I'm debating brewing a third cup of coffee, and my math homework remains unfinished. I'm running headfirst into the fact that much of what the homework asks (and surely the exam as well) has not been covered by my professor. Which is fine, but I'm going to have to adjust my plan of attack.</p>

 <p>I am going to read and take notes on the ~100 pages of chapter 10, try to distill it down. I need to regroup, refocus, come back fresh in an hour and power through the chapter tonight.  </p>

  <p><b>Update 3- </b><br>
It's Sunday, December 2nd. It's 10:53am and I'm rattling along the rails to New Haven. I'm going to a bookstore/cafe. Thanks to my chemistry lab partner, progress has been made on the lab report front, as I'm still in a deadlock with mathematics. I did have a breakthrough in understanding how the sums of unlike trig functions can be rewritten as a single function through transformations. By setting the sum of unlike trig functions equal to the sum of angles formula, we create a system of nonlinear equations, where the transformations can be solved for algebraically.
