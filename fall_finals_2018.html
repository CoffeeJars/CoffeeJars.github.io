  <h1>Fall Finals 2018</h1>
  <p><b>The Goal- </b><br>Straight A's for the fall 2018 semester. </p>
  <p><b>Update 1- </b><br>Today is Friday, November 30th, 2018. I am writing this in the deserted third floor of the Buley Library. It is 3:57pm.</p>
  <p>The first step is to complete all my unfinished homework for the remainder of the term. With this out of the way, I can focus my sole attention on preparing for finals.</p>
  <p><b>The Aforementioned Unfinished Homework-</b>
    <ul>
      <li>INQ 391 - Portfolio Binder </li>
      <li><del>INQ 391 - Final Reflection Essay</del></li>
      <li><del>MAT 122 - Online Practice Problems</del></li>
      <li><del>CHE 120 - Lab Report</del></li>
    </ul>
  </p>


  <p><b>Update 2- </b><br>
    Today is Saturday, the first of December, 2018. It's exactly 8:30pm. I'm debating brewing a third cup of coffee, and my math homework remains unfinished. I'm running headfirst into the fact that much of what the homework asks (and surely the exam as well) has not been covered by my professor. Which is fine, but I'm going to have to adjust my plan of attack.</p>

 <p>I am going to read and take notes on the ~100 pages of chapter 10, try to distill it down. I need to regroup, refocus, come back fresh in an hour and power through the chapter tonight.  </p>

  <p><b>Update 3- </b><br>
    It's Sunday, December 2nd. It's 10:53am and I'm rattling along the rails to New Haven. I'm going to a bookstore/cafe. Thanks to my chemistry lab partner, progress has been made on the lab report front, as I'm still in a deadlock with mathematics. I did have a breakthrough in understanding how the sums of unlike trig functions can be rewritten as a single function through transformations. By setting the sum of unlike trig functions equal to the sum of angles formula, we create a system of nonlinear equations, where the transformations can be solved for algebraically.
  </p>


  <p><b>Update 4- </b><br>
    Well this is not going as I would have hoped. It's 8:37pm, coffee is going on right after I post this. Two more sections of math to go. I will detail below how to solve the trig system of equations. The one good thing is that I finished my reflection essay for INQ 391. Took me about 20 minutes to write three pages. </p>
  <p><b>Rewrite 3sin(x) + 6cos(x) in the form Asin(x+`phi`)</b></p>
  <p>   All we need to remember for this problem are two identities:
    <ol>
      <li>sin(`alpha + beta`) = `cos(alpha)sin(beta) + sin(alpha)cos(beta)`</li>
      <li>`cos^2(theta)+sin^2(theta)=1`</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>By setting the original equation equal to the sum identity, we get an equation that can be simplified:</p>
  <p>
    `3sin(x) + 6cos(x) =  Acos(phi)sin(beta) + Asin(phi)cos(beta)`

  </p>
  <p>
    Looking at the balanced equation, you can see that if it's balanced then:<br>
    `Acos(phi) = 3`<br>
    `Asin(phi) = 6`
    </p>
  <p>This is because on the left side of the equation sin(x) is being multiplied by 3, on the right sin(`beta`) is being multiplied by `Acos(phi)`. Therefore: `Acos(phi) = 3` and `Asin(phi) = 6`.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since we know the value of Asin(`phi`) and Acos(`phi`) we can use the second Pythagorean identity to solve for the value of A. </p>
  <p>
    `A(cos^2(phi) + sin^2(phi) = 1)`<br>
    `A^2cos^2(phi) + A^2sin^2(phi) = A^2`<br>
    `3^2 + 6^2 = A^2`<br>
    `A = 3sqrt(5)`

  </p>
  <p>
    Now we have everything we need to solve for `phi`.</p>
  <p>
    `3sqrt(5)cos(phi) = 3`<br>
    `cos(phi) = 3/(3sqrt(5))`<br>
    `phi = cos^-1 (1/sqrt(5))`
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally putting it all together!</p>
  <p>
    `3sqrt(5)sin(x + 63Â°)`
  </p>
  <p>PS: `phi` is only roughly 63 degrees...</p>


  <p><b>Update 5-</b><br>
Lab report is complete! It's 10:29pm. I'm going to read over chapter 6 of my Computer Science textbook for my quiz tomorrow and head to bed.</p>


  <p><b>Update 6- </b><br>
    Things might be looking up? It's 10pm, Monday December 3rd. I'm brewing coffee and about to attack the last section of math. I'm going to get two hours of hard studying in and head to bed around midnight.</p>
  <p>
    Tomorrow I have work as a math tutor at 8am - 9:30am. After work I plan on getting another hour or two of review done before my exam. </p>

  <p>
    With all this studying I should be fine. Should.
  </p>
  <p>
    In other news my chemistry lab is officially over. I finish with a 96% overall, which is a relief. Interesting fact: I wrote 10,188 words across my three lab reports.
    </p>


  <p><b>Update 7- </b><br>
    Finally. Online math work is completed. Too bad it's December 4th, and my test is in less than 2 hours.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm writing this in the math library, over a cup of coffee from the bagel wagon (since conn hall let me down again). I'm going to compile some questions and see my professor before the exam. Today is also my last day of INQ 391, after my exam I have to finish the portfolio. </p>
  <p>Wish me luck</p>
