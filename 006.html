<p class="title">gluttony & sloth</p>    
    
<p> I almost did not write a post today. <br>
Today was okay. I feel slightly guilty about how unproductive it was. <br>
I purchased a new pair of shoes for the gym. Not much else. </p>

<p> My poor stomach. I had all you can eat sushi for lunch and eye-watering wings for dinner. My innards feel like a washer’s heavy load spin cycle. </p>

<p> In more positive news: I saw an old friend today. Let’s call him D. We worked out (not really), got food, and caught up. <br>
D and I graduated from the same high school last year. We mostly talked about who else we had seen from our class and what everyone was up to. <br>
That’s what you talk about with old classmates it seems. </p>

<p> Speaking of school, I set up a meeting with my advisor and have been pulling together a few schedules for next semester. </p>

<p> I have homework that needs to be done, a gym session to be made up, tickets to be paid, schedules to be made, emails to be read, and my eyelids have elephants on them. </p>

<p> Today slipped by like salmon through the maw of a grizzly.<br> I’m sorry.<br> When I’m tired I make bad nature similes. </p>
