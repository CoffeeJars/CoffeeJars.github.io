<h2>Sample Post</h2>



<div class="col1">

<p> This is <b>not</b> a blog post, or anything of the kind. </p>
<p> This is just me figuring out the layout. </p>

<h3 id="subtopic1">Subtopic 1</h3>
<p> The structure of the post itself has been split between a main column for text, and a table of contents and information column. This second column has a lovely monospaced IBM font which draws no attention to itself </p>

<p> I also found out how to link to specific parts of a page! And have taken advantage of that in the outline. </p>


<h3 id="subtopic2">Subtopic 2</h3>

<p> What’s this? A non-white background, how very brave. I opted for a pale blue green color. It doesn’t grab the eye and demand attention, its soothing as a background. White has the unfortunate effect of harshness. </p>

<p> Subtopics are also Roboto, but a smaller size, and also are colored slightly (#003040). This murky blue is almost black but fades nicely against the background. By having a subtitle closer in color to the background than the body font, it evens out the divide in ‘eye-grab’ between them. </p>

<h3 id="subtopic2">Subtopic 3</h3>

<p>I've decided to use a sans-serif front for the headers, it gives a nice and sleek feeling, like a blogger site but with the fat trimmed. The obvious choice was Roboto. I haven’t yet broken down and bought fonts, though with my obsessive redesigning of this site at least twice a month, I may have to. </p>

<p>I’ve opted for a serif body, Garamond. I find it’s really easy on the eyes and reminds me of old books. The exact font is EB Garamond. </p>
