<p>Everything from my old blog. Starting from the first post. March 11th, 2018. </p>

<h3 id="subtopic1">Spring Break</h3>
<p class="tag2">March 11th, 2018.</p>
<p>The world may be trying to kill me.<br>
Last week a real estate agent crashed into my car on the parkway, a backyard tree collapsed right where I had been standing, and I burned my mouth on a pizza topping. <br>
Some of these are more severe than others. </p>
<p>At least it’s spring break, which will give me a chance to collect myself (and replace my missing passenger side mirror).<br>
I hate sitting around, so I am making this blog to keep myself busy and accountable over break.<br>
I have lots of plans for things that I want to get done: homework, hiking trips, gym sessions, car repairs, creative writing, video editing, reading, cooking, seeing friends, video games, and more. <br>            </p>
<p>Stay busy, stay happy. </p>  

<h3 id="subtopic2">Sleeping Giant</h3>
<p class="tag2">March 12th, 2018.</p>
<p>I went hiking today!<br>
In retrospect it was not my brightest idea to go for a rugged climb after a night of snowfall. Especially wearing Asics with soles like sea glass. Every trail was covered in a layer of compact snow. Luckily there were only a few close calls and a very wet pair of pants. Quinnipiac looked beautiful from the top of the blue trail. </p>

<p>I need to start pulling together a class schedule for next semester. It seems as if I will be confined to Connecticut for another year at least. More on this as it develops. </p>

<p>Later, in a booth at North Haven’s “Athena II” diner, I overheard the most interesting conversation between two men. It spanned halfway houses, schizophrenia, the pope, the possibilities for life after death, and the underground trade of supermarket coupons. I hope when I’m middle aged that I’ll be able to meet friends in dinners and have similar conversations. </p>

<p>In the PM I hit the gym. Still running the nsuns 5day routine (against my better judgment). Bench press felt fine. I added conventional curls after two sets of hammer curls. When doing T2 overhead press I rowed the weight for sets of 20. After 5 sets I felt my forearms give out. Pumped, stiff, with jittering fingers, it was great. </p>

<p> See you space cowboy...</p>   
<h3 id="subtopic3">Snow Day</h3>
<p class="tag2">March 13th, 2018.</p>
<p>Didn’t go to the gym. Didn’t clean my room. Didn’t get any homework done. Didn’t go anywhere. So why am I still happy with today? <br>
Let me tell you.<br> I have been meandering around the idea of trying to crack my way into the United States Naval Academy, and today I decided I was going to do it. This is a big deal. Now I know which direction to go in, and what I have to do. Not only that! I’ve decided I want to be an English major. I love language, and books, and reading, and just all of it. </p>
<p>This just means that I will be running a bit more, shooting for at least one powerlifting meet, and maybe retaking the SATs. </p>
<p>It’s an exciting road ahead, but now it’s time for bed. </p>
<p> The boat is launched, let's chase the horizon.</p>
    
<h3 id="subtopic4">iced coffee, empty stomachs</h3>
<p class="tag2">March 14th, 2018.</p>   
<ul>
<li>Dieting down to 200lbs.</li>
<li>Someone close to me was denied from a school they loved. </li>
<li>Car is fixed. </li>
<li>Practiced Romanian deadlifts. </li>
<li>Went to a café to clear my mind. </li>
<li>Declared as an English major.</li>
<li>Made a 1000lbs club <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k0QjX1R9WI&feature=youtu.be">video.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Just scraps today. Stay tuned. </p>

<h3 id="subtopic5">wonton soup</h3>
<p class="tag2">March 15th, 2018.</p> 
    
<p> Another post filled with scattered thoughts. <br>
I am sipping from a mug of wonton soup as I type this. I always order it from the same Chinese restaurant. I feel as though someone has staged a coup and restructured the place. They never used to give plastic takeout containers, only metal. Their wonton soup stock used to have more scallions and was less colloidal. Worse still, the nice hostess with the shallow-water eyes seems to have been fired. <br>
I can only hope that she has received a large inheritance or has started a new life as a coal baron or perhaps is now the captain of a fishing trawler in the South China Sea. </p>
<p> I worked out today. <br>
Still need to stretch & run. <br>
At least I am finishing my nsuns workouts. <br>
Something that I noticed today was that changing my grip while doing barbell curls made them more comfortable. Normally, the <del>external rotation</del> radial deviation from the straight bar puts a strain on my forearm, but when I switched to a ‘false grip’ it felt a lot better! <br>
From now on I will be sticking with hammer and barbell curls for bicep work. </p>
<p> There are days when I hate my Macbook Pro, and today was one of them. <br>
I needed to install a third party program off github (that was in alpha!) to be able to control the audio levels for various applications. This <b>simple</b> functionality is completely missing from OSX. It really boils my blood that people pay top dollar for these slick, apple embossed, steel brushed laptops; only to find that if they are locked into controlling one big master volume dial. </p>
<p> I made another video today. <br>
Link is <a href=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KfmxuwU-u4&list=LLn_AIk8YHs6s-QbktQh_XCQ&index=1”>here</a>! I was inspired by my favorite anime, Neon Genesis Evangelion, to create a mix of songs that reflect the somber outlook of Shinji Ikari. It’s an excellent mix to study to. <br>
I am trying really hard to make a couple videos before my 30-day trial of final cut pro runs out. <br>
Lord knows I can’t afford it. </p>
<p>What are blogs if not random musings?</p>   
    

<h3 id="subtopic6">gluttony & sloth</h3>
<p class="tag2">March 16th, 2018.</p> 
<p> I almost did not write a post today. <br>
Today was okay. I feel slightly guilty about how unproductive it was. <br>
I purchased a new pair of shoes for the gym. Not much else. </p>
<p> My poor stomach. I had all you can eat sushi for lunch and eye-watering wings for dinner. My innards feel like a washer’s heavy load spin cycle. </p>
<p> In more positive news: I saw an old friend today. Let’s call him D. We worked out (not really), got food, and caught up. <br>
D and I graduated from the same high school last year. We mostly talked about who else we had seen from our class and what everyone was up to. <br>
That’s what you talk about with old classmates it seems. </p>
<p> Speaking of school, I set up a meeting with my advisor and have been pulling together a few schedules for next semester. </p>
<p> I have homework that needs to be done, a gym session to be made up, tickets to be paid, schedules to be made, emails to be read, and my eyelids have elephants on them. </p>
<p> Today slipped by like salmon through the maw of a grizzly.<br> I’m sorry.<br> When I’m tired I make bad nature similes. </p>   
    

<h3 id="subtopic7">old ink</h3>
<p class="tag2">March 17th, 2018.</p> 
 <p> One thing that I love about writing these daily little blog posts is how it has gotten me writing again. I love coming back to my computer and seeing an open word doc with a half-finished post. </p>
<p> As part of my dantean trek to the Naval Academy I am going to start running with my younger brother. He runs both varsity track and cross country so I am sure that he will leave me in the dust. </p>    
<p>I never finished writing this.</p>
    

<h3 id="subtopic8">scapula blues</h3>
<p class="tag2">March 20th, 2018.</p> 
 <p> I think I overdid It with the barbell rows. </p>
<p> I’ve been in excruciating pain recently. I think I ripped the muscles of my upper back, possibly the connective tissue. <br>
Puffing my chest out hurts. Breathing hurts. Retracting my scapula hurts. Sitting hurts. Laying down hurts. <br>
<br>It’s the wakeup call I needed. <br>
Since I started working out I’ve carelessly neglected stretching or warming up. <br>
I’ve started. For the past two days I have followed the <a href=”https://phrakture.github.io/starting-stretching.html”>Starting Stretching</a> routine and It’s been great! Hopefully it’s just not too late for me and my incredibly tight hamstrings and hip flexors. </p>

<p>I think I will be making a before/after video to show the difference that a month of stretching makes. </p>

<p>I hate this constant pain. It is so hard to focus on my stack of homework while I’m aching, while I can’t sit up, while I can’t sleep. </p>

<p>I will be switching from the nsunsLP routine to a PPL. Taking Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday off and then starting on Thursday. Or maybe a different program? Hepburn inspired routines seem cool as well. It’s something I need to put thought into. </p>
    
<p> I want to try out the zercher squat and the steinborn squat!</p>
    
<p> I also want to replay a couple video games from my youth. </p>
    
    <p> So much to do. So little time.</p>

<p> More than a foot of snow en route to bury CT again. </p>
    

<h3 id="subtopic9">white skies</h3>
<p class="tag2">March 21st, 2018.</p> 
<p> Thank god.<br>My political science midterm was moved to Friday. </p>
<p> School closes at 12 today– means I escape the clutches of my evening shift. <br>
Busy day. I’ve been working on a new fitness routine to replace nsunsLP. I also have a few essays to sand down. </p>
<p> This site’s markup looks like impressionist finger painting from a toddler’s fever dream. I should probably clean it up. Make a separate css file. Try and stick to a format. <br>But how can I do that if I can't even bother to write complete sentences for these posts?
<p> In good news my back is feeling much better. Looks like I just ripped up my rhomboids, serratus anterior, traps, etc etc.</p>
<p> Too busy to write much. </p>

    
<h3 id="subtopic10">pulled plug</h3>
<p class="tag2">March 23rd, 2018.</p> 
<p> I’ll be dashing to the gym in half an hour so this should be a quick post. <br>
I’ve decided that from now until Monday morning (3/26/18), I'll be cutting down on the phone use.<br> Just as a break. To enjoy the present a little more. To stop worrying over silly things.  </p>
<p> I think it will be good for me. </p>

<p> Thoughts: <br>
“We are a school of small spoons in a big cutlery drawer” <br>
“You don't know your real friends until they tell you they won't help you return the ti89 titanium graphing calculator that you bought from target” <br>
I need to transfer. Perhaps not to the Naval Academy? <br>
I’m going to replay half-life tonight I think. <br>
Wizard people, dear reader is great, so is Freeman’s mind <br>
I really need to learn how to use commas huh. That would help things. <br>
Still need to finish Productivity Project + make a book page <br>
So tired of so many people. <br>
I am going to join the book club. </p>
<p>Oh this post is so... sandpaper, a cat's tongue, turf on a cold night, a dry throat, oak tree bark, roofing shingles, bristles across a cheek, OSB Plywood, rough. Whatever.
</p>
    
<h3 id="subtopic11">tired of brick and glass</h3>
<p class="tag2">March 26th, 2018.</p> 
<p>I <i>probably</i> won’t be posting as much. Not daily. </p>
<p> I have things to do. More important things to do. And the blog will be better for it. </p>
<p> Await more infrequent, interesting, and lengthy posts. </p> 
    
    
<h3 id="subtopic12">april is the cruelest month</h3>
<p class="tag2">April 3rd, 2018.</p> 
 <p> I’m working really hard on getting it together. It can get really difficult when you’re on the treadmill of life and every step forward feels like you’re moving in place. <p>

<p> So what am I doing to pull it together? <br>
Narrowing my focus. </p>

<p> I have been trying (failing) to juggle so many things. I have been trying (failing) to commit myself to a course of action and stick with it. Narrowing my focus means cutting the fluff, cutting out the time wasters and dead ends of my life. This does not mean I am going to lock myself in my room, blockade the door with books and never leave a productive cocoon. This doesn’t work. Trust me I’ve tried. It just means that I will use my time on important things and waste my time on things that truly bring me happiness, that enrich my life, that I enjoy. For a nerd like me that might be re-watching Star Trek, or reading, or spending time with people who I enjoy the company of. </p>

<p> My Geography professor last semester had a way of describing college. Arriving at college is like standing on the shore, looking out at the ocean, you arrive young, dumb, and clueless. Choosing a major is lashing together driftwood to build a raft. Taking classes is paddling out into the water. Some rifts will sink. Statistically more than half of college hopefuls will drop out. Some paddle out a short ways and realize they built the wrong raft, they dive out and swim back to shore. In four or so years your battered craft will cross the lagoon, and you’ll cross the stage of graduation. </p> 

<p> I think that I have been playing around on the shore for too long. </p> 

<p> So let’s put an end to this thumb twiddling. I’m declaring as a geology major. I’ve always loved sciences. I adored AP bio back in high school. It will set me up to have a nice outdoor job hopefully. It also appeases that conservationists/ecologist side of me that wants to save the planet.  </p>

<p> More uncharacteristic decisiveness: for a long time, I have been toying with the idea of going to the Naval Academy. For a week it will be all that I think about, and the next week I will be second guessing my service academy zeal. No longer. I’ve made my mind up. I’m doing it. Let’s kick this into gear. I can build a great application package. I have the physical attributes; I’m cultivating the leadership; I’ve got the 4.0. I know I can do this. </p>

<p> It’s really about the mindset. It’s so easy to be bogged down. It’s incredibly easy to let problem after problem swallow you up into a never ending pit of quick sand. Oh I’m not a good runner and not flexible and not good enough at math and- Just stop. It’s about the mindset. Maybe I’ve been watching too much Eric Bugenhagen on YouTube, but tenacity and perseverance never hurt. Being cynical has cost me too much already. It’s time to turn the frown upside down- so to speak. It’s a mindset. I think it’s important not to confuse mindset with motivation. Motivation is fleeting and comes and goes with the day, having the correct mindset will bring out the silver on grey days. </p>

<p> I want to cut down what I do to a manageable level. This means probably no more video editing, less radical redesigns of my blog, and a bunch of other things. </p>


<p> My studies- pretty self explanatory. I want to keep up the good academic work. Creativity- I want to read and write more. Recently I have been reading a book of short stories and loving it. My free time- I think free time is essential. Without it you burn out. I want to try and use my free time better. More volunteering, interning. I am looking into opportunities to become involved in environmental protection in CT! I want to spend less time on the people who do nothing for my life, more time on those who make me happy, more time on things that make me engaged, and more time on things which will build my raft. </p>

<p> Let’s talk fitness.  I’ll be doing my first powerlifting competition this July! I don’t care that I am woefully weak. It will be a good experience to have under my belt. Not to mention something to motivate me. I will be dropping 10lbs to get into the 93kg class. Still following the StepHep routine, but adding in way more reps than stated in the program. It’s a mindset goddamnit. I also will be adding in some running to prep for the USNA’s CFA. It should help my heart and challenge me in a new way. Too often do people get into these trenches where they do the same lifts for the same amount of reps. Adding in running and peaking for a meet should help to keep things fun. In a awful sort of way. </p>

<p> I have 20oz of light roast in me and I’ve got work to do. I’m hyped. </p>

<h3 id="subtopic13">Life Stuff and Motivational Fluff</h3>
<p class="tag2">April 15th, 2018.</p> 

<p> I have been reading and loving <i>The Power of Habits</i>. Great book. Inspiring and interesting and applicable all in one. When I finish I’ll be detailing my more complete thoughts. </p>

<p> A quick life update:</p> 

<p> The finish line is in sight. School ends in less than a month. I have an SAT retake looming. I’m still trying to squeeze every last drop of sour-time from life’s lemons. </p>

<p> Still plummeting towards 200lbs bodyweight. Still racing towards a 6-minute mile. Still reaching for my toes. A close squat grip in cahoots with excessive weekly pressing volume seem to have nibbled away at the edges of my elbow tendons. The inflexibility doesn’t help. Ice and band work seem to be reviving the joint. The pain is on the retreat. <br>
I have my first powerlifting meet in three months. </p>

<p> In my last update, I talked about focusing on four things. I lied. In reality I’ve been pouring myself into fitness, and academics, and not much else. My social life and free time have both suffered. This is okay. Life is about allocating resources. Perhaps a day will come when I will wish that I was more well-rounded during my freshman year of college. Perhaps not. </p>

<p> I just know that I have a goal in mind.<br> And if you aren’t chasing something, what are you doing? <br>
Don’t be content to let life pull you along. Don’t watch life go by episode after episode like some Netflix binge. Life isn’t great, but it has its moments, and they’re worth living. <br>
I don’t mean to sound like some bullshit motivational speaker when I say these things, but in a generation of aimlessness it might serve us well to pick up an instrument, book, ball, even a barbell. In an age where people are crippled with anxieties and distractions and social constructs larger than human evolutionary capacity, it might serve us well to chase something. It might serve us well to set our own course. </p>
 

<h3 id="subtopic14">Cranium full of alphabet soup</h3>
<p class="tag2">April 16th, 2018.</p> 

<p>
Lots of rambling tonight. This is a freezer for ideas I might want to develop later. You’ve been warned. 
</p>

<p>
The past can be like a pair of shoelaces. It can get knotted and lightheadedly tight. You’ll want to keep someone in your life, so you’ll double or triple knot them in. Knot after knot. Like scar tissue that scaffolds wounds or that cheap plywood in Home Depot. Sometimes its for nothing. Sometimes you’re left with blisters. Get new laces. And learn to not tie so tight. 
</p>

<p>
Notebooks are great. Buy one. Carry one. Use one. It doesn’t matter what kind. Honestly my head has never felt clearer. Say what you will about the digital revolution– nothing will replace a paper notebook. 
</p>

<p>
Still really enjoying my habit book. As I delve more into the science behind the human clockwork, I can’t help but see how disruptive phones can be. This year Samsung launched a phone without Wi-Fi or data in South Korea. Tempting. 
</p>

<center>
<p>
sun's pouring cream
<br>
across the horizon
<br>
looks like another
<br>
light and sweet,
<br>    
<i>morning</i>
</p>
</center>
    
<p>
I was looking back through old notebooks and saw this. It was scribbled on a napkin and taped to a page. I remember writing it at Donut Crazy and watching the sun rise over Stratford. 
</p>

<p>
Don’t give up before you’ve started. People always rationalize themselves out of chasing something. “I’m too tall to be a gymnast” “I don’t have the right insertions to be a bodybuilder” “I don’t have the legs to be a runner” “I don’t have enough fast twitch muscle tissue to be a sprinter.” Honestly. The people who never find their gifts are the ones who never try. I see It everywhere in the gym. It’s as if the fear of failure is sedating chunks of the population. It’s better to fail. I’d know.
</p>

<p>
Instant gratification. I was thinking about Instant gratification. Humans are gratification driven animals. So much of modern society exists to prey on this facet of our humanity. Think financing, Spotify premium, steroids. These exist to fill a niche in the market for quick gratification, whether it’s the new car, the song, or engorged muscle tissue. 
</p>

<p>
I’ve mentioned it in the past, but I want to eventually write at length about motivation v. discipline. This is something so many people have a warped perception of. Anecdotally: 
motivation is what I get after a good cup of coffee, discipline is what gets me out the door.
</p>  
    

<h3 id="subtopic15">minimalism is not</h3>
<p class="tag2">April 19th, 2018.</p>     

<p>Minimalism in the 21st century is a perversion of the artistic movement from which it takes its name. </p>

<p>
Online minimalism has created objective standards: <center>“Have you ditched your car?”<br> “Do you have more than 5 pieces of furniture?”<br> “Do you own more than 100 things?”<br> “Does your closet have more than 6 shirts?”<br> “Why do you own more than 3 books?”<br> “Why aren’t your rooms painted white?”<br><br></center> This contradicts the functionality of minimalism. Radical online standards of 3-piece wardrobes and bleak Scandinavian interiors have led to the destruction of function. Embracing this deindividualization is a one-way street from ‘too much’ to ‘too little.’ The idea that minimalism looks a certain way, that it can be copied like a recipe, is harmful.
</p>

<p>
Minimalism doesn’t replace consumerism– it changes the flavor. Self identifying ‘minimalists’ purchase ‘minimal’ products, and the free market is only too happy to supply. 
</p>

<p>
Online minimalism and its siren call of simplicity and happiness and Zen has led to an epidemic. Too many fall into the trap of using minimalism as medicine. Displacing their anxieties and conflicts onto their possessions. Reducing what they own instead of addressing their problems. 
</p>

<p>
Minimize friends, minimize food, minimize furniture, minimize fashion, minimize finances, and these are just the F’s. At a certain point you are no longer improving your life, you are gutting it. 
</p>

<p>
Minimalism is focusing your life, it’s an allocation of attention, It’s realizing the relativity of less. <br>
Minimalism isn’t a hashtag, it isn’t a style, it isn’t a number. 
</p>

<p>
 I’ve arrived.<br> A field of J. Crew models. White Mannequins. Boat shoes pointed out on waxed floor.  Leather wallets, heavy credit cards, attorney business cards. Nautical belts and chino. Smiles that curve like stock charts. Fathers check blackberries. Mothers take notes. 
    </p> 
    
<p>
I really am in Middletown.
</p>
    
<p>
We stand for the pledge.<br> It feels different. 
A girl with a blazer and a vanilla ice cream face is talking about asthma. Disqualifying.  There are Marines in tailored suits (extra room in chest and sleeve). There are refreshments. <i>Store brand– </i>  I hear a woman scoff. 
 
</p>

<p>
But how did I get here? Think back up rainy route 91. Think back over the day. The week. The year. Think of brick and glass. Think of that hot day wearing blue oxford and red graduation gown. How did I get here?

<h3 id="subtopic18">summer’s doorstep</h3>
<p class="tag2">May 1st, 2018.</p> 
<p>
Finally, a straightforward post. 
</p>

<p>
The semester is drawing to a close. I don’t believe it. My first year of college nearly over.  I can’t say that I am happy with all of it; can’t say that I am proud of all of it, but I’m doing better. Much better than high school. 
</p>

<p>
I hate downtime. Fortunately, it seems my summer is going to be anything but relaxing.
</p>

<p>
I won’t be doing anything <i>too</i> crazy. Some college students go on road trips, or try to live an idealized French lifestyle, or get lost in a jungle, or try to piece high school friendships back together. As fun as these all might sound, I’m determined to improve myself this summer. 
</p>



<p>
Over my vacation I will be migrating to a static Jekyll site. This will remove the pain usually associated with updating my blog. Right now to write an entry I have to: create a new html page, type the post in plaintext, copy the post into the page and add formatting, edit index.html to include a link to the new post. This is ridiculous. It’s backwards even by my standards. <br>
Creating a Jekyll theme will keep me working on (and updating) this blog. 
</p>

<p>
I’ll also be working. Most likely in a state park! Thanks to my campus job I am technically a state employee, a state employee who is transferring to the department of environmental protection for a seasonal job. It’ll be my sixth job. I’ve gone from construction worker to dishwasher to bakery assistant to barista to teller to Math Emporium assistant. What a wild ride its been. 
</p>

<p>
Besides my department of environmental protection job this summer I have a couple other commitments lined up. I’ll be teaching kids about endangered shore birds. I’ll also probably be spending a week or so living in the Vermont woods, working on the Long Trail.
</p>

<p>
I’m longing for those sunny days when I can bike to the beach, go for a walk, read in the sun, take the train somewhere, just soak up the world.
</p>

<p>
On the fitness front I’ve got a steep summer ahead. When school ends I’ll be joining a real gym and begin some real training for my first powerlifting meet. I’m excited to leave crunch behind. I hate not being able to use chalk. I hate the soft pop music. I hate middle-aged women who bounce on ellipticals, like discount fruit, and wrinkle their noses on every deadlift eccentric. I hate high school kids who squat >100 lbs with backs like parabolas and scream on every rep. 
<br> <br>That felt good to get out. <br> <br>
 I’ll be dieting down to around 200lbs and shooting for a 1100lbs total! I’m a little nervous of course, but it should be a good experience. <br>
I also have to begin training for the CFA, the standardized test for admittance into the United States Naval Academy. Once my powerlifting meet is over I will dial back the compounds and get my feet under me a little more. When I took the NROTC AFA, I was able to hit 80+ push-ups, a 6-minute mile, and nearly 100 sit-ups. Back then I weighed 170lbs, the bodyweight movements will definitely be a lot harder carrying 30+ more lbs. Still confident though. 
</p>



<p>
The strenuous process of applying to a service academy is deserving of it’s own post, but over the summer I’ll be assembling the pieces of my Navy application. 
</p>


<p>
I was also selected to become a peer mentor for my university! I have to attend a couple summer training sessions but that will be a good experience and leadership position for the books. For those who don’t know, a peer mentor is a guide of sorts for the freshman class. They’re implanted into freshman classes and form the initially connection between freshman and college. I’m actually quite excited.
</p>

<p>
College students spend a third of their time procrastinating. Americans average four hours a day on their phones. Scared yet? I’ve been reading “How to break up with your phone” and it has been turning me into something of a technophobe. But really, look around and one out of every two people you see under 30 will have their face buried in a phone. I’ve been trying to appreciate life a little more. Live in the present. Be more productive. All those clichés. 
</p>

<p>
It is also high time that I got my finances in order. Which means budgeting. At the start of college, I created an excel spreadsheet with about 900 cells and percentages to break down hourly wages, it had a file size of about 6mb, and was a terrible way to budget. Simple and effective is the way to go. Think Pareto's principle. Start with income, subtract expenses, allocate the rest. I’m aiming to build up my emergency fund again, put more into my IRA, get myself into a good place for college in the fall.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I will be prepping for my SAT, my third SAT. I have the second one in a week to set a benchmark, and will be prepping like mad after that. I’m aiming high, 1400-1500 at least.
</p>

<p>
What a wild summer it is going to be.

<p class="tag2">May 1st, 2018.</p>   
<p>
I never imagined I would ever be concerned with the minutiae of barbell grips. <br> 
I’ve been acclimating myself to the thumb-wrenching hook grip. 
</p>

<p>
It is absolutely beautiful out today. I laid in the grass and studied history. It was the most peaceful I’ve felt in a long time. 
</p>

<p>
My afternoon consists of homework in a swanky coffee bar and the daily gym penance.

Zeno of Elea was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher of southern Italy. He is best known for his paradox describing motion to be impossible. Take any distance between two points, divide it in two, and always travel this halved distance. You will never reach your destination.

<p>I was inspired by <a href="http://mythicalstrength.blogspot.com/2015/04/challenge-workouts-and-finishers.html">this post</a>, and have been incorporating hellish finishers to my workouts.</p>
    
<h3 id="subtopic21">all types of french presses</h3>
<p class="tag2">May 9th, 2018.</p> 
<p>This morning I cracked my eyes with a French press coffee, and went to the gym where I was made to do the French press exercise. </p>

    
<p>
My teammates didn’t understand why I found that so interesting. 
It just got me thinking how the same words can hold different meanings to different people. The fluidity of language, perception is reality, all that stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
One French press tasted delicious, the other made me lose feeling in both shoulders. 
</p>    
 

<h3 id="subtopic22">gym anniversary </h3>
<p class="tag2">May 9th, 2018.</p>
<p> The last thing I could do right now is form coherent thoughts. But you, dear readers, should be used to that by now. </p>

<p> Today I switched gyms. My 1-year membership to Crunch Fitness expired. I guess it’s an anniversary of sorts. After a year: I’ve deadlifted 405, benched 275, and squatted 365. </p>

<p> My new gym is to crunch what the United States Army is to the Boy Scouts. </p>

<p> I went from a prince of the weight room, to the bottom of the barrel, a sardine in the Mariana trench. I’m also told what to lift, when, how much, all the details. I like that part. </p> 

<p> So today I was benching with T–, a guy who has three herniated discs, no surgery. Watching his face twist in agony on every rep didn’t feel too good in my stomach. He still lifted more than me though. </p>

<p> Long day. I ended up wandering the streets of Stratford, sore but too awake to sleep. It was dark except for pools of streetlight. I felt like a revenant, cursed to walk the pavement in search of rest. How poetic. Turns out I don’t sleep well in the heat. </p>
    
<h3 id="subtopic23">changing tracks</h3>
<p class="tag2">May 10th, 2018.</p> 
<p>
I survived finals week. Usually when people say that they <i>survived</i> something, it’s followed by a laugh, I’m not laughing. I lost 10 pounds. I went from a <del>robust</del> porky 215 to a linguine 203. </p>

<p> 
I realize that a lot of my recent posts, if you can call them that, have dealt with my never-ending and borderline obsessive quest for physical fitness. To keep things fresh, I’m going to mix things up a little today and talk about some other things that I have been up to.  
</p> 

<p>
I’ve been cooking!<br> I particularly like breakfast foods, waffles, pancakes, bacon, ham, eggs, even toast. A cup of coffee on the side to keep my caffeine habit in check and I have the makings of a great morning. 
</p>

<p>
Today for example I made a delicious breakfast sandwich. <br>
<p>
    Stephen's HEC
<br>    In a cast iron pan with medium-low heat.
<br>fry:
<br>two (2) eggs
<br>three (3) slices of ham
<br>chopped red pepper
<br>chopped onions
<br>
<br>Optionally you can add 2 strips of bacon or 1 sausage patty for some additional protein and flavor. 
<br><br>Make sure not to overcook the eggs, season with salt and pepper after you flip them, and add a slice of American cheese to each egg. 
<br><br> It’s delicious on Portuguese rolls, hard rolls, or a toasted bagel. 
    </p>
    
<h3 id="subtopic24">how to break up with your phone</h3>
<p class="tag2">May 16th, 2018.</p>    
 
<p>
I recommend that everyone read, <i>How to Break Up with Your Phone</i>, by Catherine Price. What an eye opening book. The average American consumer spends five (5!) hours a day on their phone. If that statistic doesn’t worry you, it should. </p>

<p>
Phone usage is linked to insomnia, stress, anxiety, depression, decreased attention span, decreased energy, decreased creativity, and much more. Excessive usage rewires your brain, and creates chemical imbalances. Not to mention the amount of productivity loss from constant notifications, or the cervical damage from constantly hunching over your phone, or the amount of money wasted on apps that are rarely used.
    </p>
    <p>
The problem is that phone usage is a subtle and widespread addiction. Without realizing it you may reach for your phone several hundred times a day. The world around us, the apps themselves, our own brain chemistry, all encourage this continual “grazing” on our phones. 
</p>
    <p>
Controlling your phone usage isn’t a silver bullet to reach nirvana, but in an evermore tired and depressed society, it may be what you need.

  <h3 id="subtopic25">Week of Turning Points</h3>
    
<p>Monday:<br>
I ran out of gas in Middletown, and learned about inertia on the rolling hills. In Hartford, I interviewed for a job at the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP). During my evening workout, I squatted 365lbs for two easy reps, doubling my previous record. </p>
    
<p>Tuesday:<br>
I had my sutures removed. I’ll always have a scar above my left eye, a reminder to tie my shoes before farmer’s walks. I ate a decadent 1000+ calorie Cinnabon. My competition bench training was pain free, and I made delicious homemade cold brew coffee. </p>

<p>Wednesday:<br>
The day began with an awful deadlift session (it lacked caffeine and metal), and ended learning about healthy social interactions from telenovelas. I was offered a job at the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. </p>

<p>Thursday:<br>
Finally! I overhead pressed 185lbs. My CoC #1 gripper came in the mail. I can almost close it. I made this new blog layout. Bit of a slow, blue day. </p>
    
<p>Friday:<br>
Today I started work at CT DEEP. The building is old and beautiful, like a Manhattan transplant. I bought lunch from a food truck, ate in Bushnell park. 
</p>
    
<p>Saturday:<br>
I had a great training session: supinated rows, snatch grip rows, volume leg press. Played tennis. Splurged on sushi (in a physical and financial sense). Walked along the beach and discovered the only cactus native to Connecticut, The Eastern Prickly Pear (Opuntia humifusa). </p>

<p>Sunday:<br>
I caught up with some old friends who I hadn’t seen since high school. We had a great time. We went out for sushi (again) and screwed around in a local mall. It’s not what you do, its who you’re with. </p>
