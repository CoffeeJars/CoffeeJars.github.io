    <h1>Books I've Read</h1>
    <p><h2>Flatland</h2>
    Edwin Abbott Abbott. Completed Dec 6th 2018. A really interesting little read. Almost totally devoid of character in the traditional sense, except for snippets seen in the description of the nearly regular isosceles grandfather or hushed-tone descriptions of the circle class. Plot falls a little...flat. Makes up for all of this with the engaging premise. Could be read as a veiled criticism of the Victorian era. 3/5.</p>
