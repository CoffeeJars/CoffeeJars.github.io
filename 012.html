<p class="title">april is the cruelest month</p>    

<p> I’m working really hard on getting it together. It can get really difficult when you’re on the treadmill of life and every step forward feels like you’re moving in place. <p>

<p> So what am I doing to pull it together? <br>
Narrowing my focus. </p>

<p> I have been trying (failing) to juggle so many things. I have been trying (failing) to commit myself to a course of action and stick with it. Narrowing my focus means cutting the fluff, cutting out the time wasters and dead ends of my life. This does not mean I am going to lock myself in my room, blockade the door with books and never leave a productive cocoon. This doesn’t work. Trust me I’ve tried. It just means that I will use my time on important things and waste my time on things that truly bring me happiness, that enrich my life, that I enjoy. For a nerd like me that might be re-watching Star Trek, or reading, or spending time with people who I enjoy the company of. </p>

<p> My Geography professor last semester had a way of describing college. Arriving at college is like standing on the shore, looking out at the ocean, you arrive young, dumb, and clueless. Choosing a major is lashing together driftwood to build a raft. Taking classes is paddling out into the water. Some rifts will sink. Statistically more than half of college hopefuls will drop out. Some paddle out a short ways and realize they built the wrong raft, they dive out and swim back to shore. In four or so years your battered craft will cross the lagoon, and you’ll cross the stage of graduation. </p> 

<p> I think that I have been playing around on the shore for too long. </p> 

<p> So let’s put an end to this thumb twiddling. I’m declaring as a geology major. I’ve always loved sciences. I adored AP bio back in high school. It will set me up to have a nice outdoor job hopefully. It also appeases that conservationists/ecologist side of me that wants to save the planet.  </p>

<p> More uncharacteristic decisiveness: for a long time, I have been toying with the idea of going to the Naval Academy. For a week it will be all that I think about, and the next week I will be second guessing my service academy zeal. No longer. I’ve made my mind up. I’m doing it. Let’s kick this into gear. I can build a great application package. I have the physical attributes; I’m cultivating the leadership; I’ve got the 4.0. I know I can do this. </p>

<p> It’s really about the mindset. It’s so easy to be bogged down. It’s incredibly easy to let problem after problem swallow you up into a never ending pit of quick sand. Oh I’m not a good runner and not flexible and not good enough at math and- Just stop. It’s about the mindset. Maybe I’ve been watching too much Eric Bugenhagen on YouTube, but tenacity and perseverance never hurt. Being cynical has cost me too much already. It’s time to turn the frown upside down- so to speak. It’s a mindset. I think it’s important not to confuse mindset with motivation. Motivation is fleeting and comes and goes with the day, having the correct mindset will bring out the silver on grey days. </p>

<p> I want to cut down what I do to a manageable level. This means probably no more video editing, less radical redesigns of my blog, and a bunch of other things. </p>

<p> I want to focus on:
<ul>
<li>my studies </li>
<li>my fitness </li>
<li>my creativity </li>
<li>my free time </li> 
</ul>
</p>

<p> My studies- pretty self explanatory. I want to keep up the good academic work. Creativity- I want to read and write more. Recently I have been reading a book of short stories and loving it. My free time- I think free time is essential. Without it you burn out. I want to try and use my free time better. More volunteering, interning. I am looking into opportunities to become involved in environmental protection in CT! I want to spend less time on the people who do nothing for my life, more time on those who make me happy, more time on things that make me engaged, and more time on things which will build my raft. </p>

<p> Let’s talk fitness.  I’ll be doing my first powerlifting competition this July! I don’t care that I am woefully weak. It will be a good experience to have under my belt. Not to mention something to motivate me. I will be dropping 10lbs to get into the 93kg class. Still following the StepHep routine, but adding in way more reps than stated in the program. It’s a mindset goddamnit. I also will be adding in some running to prep for the USNA’s CFA. It should help my heart and challenge me in a new way. Too often do people get into these trenches where they do the same lifts for the same amount of reps. Adding in running and peaking for a meet should help to keep things fun. In a awful sort of way. </p>

<p> I have 20oz of light roast in me and I’ve got work to do. I’m hyped. </p>
