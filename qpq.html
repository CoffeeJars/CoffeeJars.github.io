<header><h1>Quid pro quo productivity</h1>
</header>
<content>
<p>It's a trend I see all the time in my INQ 101 student's and myself. </p>
    <p><strong>You have an assignment due.</strong></p>
    <p>What do you do?<br>
    Do you start work on the project?</p>

<strong>Hell no.</strong>
<p>You organize your folders, clean your room, change your lockscreen, clear out your email inbox, empty out your backpack, lay out clothes for tomorrow, check social media, maybe you even write a blog post.</p>
<p>    
 Because you aren't a <em>lazy</em> or how dare I even mention <em>unproductive</em> person, you decide the best thing to do is make an outline of the project. Who cares if the outline doesn't <em>really</em> help you complete the project at all. </p>
    
    
<p>This is <strong>quid pro quo productivity</strong>, something for something productivity. It's a form of avoidance where instead of doing what's <em>really</em> important, we focus on other tasks, ones which are easier, to keep ourselves busy. Keeping busy makes us feel all nice and warm and fuzzy and productive, when the real work is being left undone.</p>
