    <h1>2<text style="margin-left: 30px;">Starting 5/3/1</text></h1>
    <p>I began working out to prepare first for NROTC and later for the USNA, both of which didn’t pan out. Despite this, fitness has become cemented down as a habit, and is likely to remain solidly in place until the day I die. </p>

    <p>Recently I have been finding it difficult balancing good workouts and my academic, student leadership, and work commitments. 5/3/1 is my solution. </p>

    <p>I feel like Jim Wendler’s program gets a bad rep for its deceptive lack of volume, or its use of a training max (using roughly 90-95% of your 1RM to calculate percentages). The truth is that both of these ‘flaws’ are actually great strengths. </p>

    <p>The program is skeletal, but keeps you in the gym, keeps you lifting, and importantly, keeps you feeling good. When you’re feeling good in the gym, the program gives you opportunities to push the intensity, with joker sets, or push the volume with first-set-last rep schemes.
</p>

<p>The same people that mock 5/3/1 are the ones who sing praises for brutal regimes like smolov, programs that work for specific purposes, but when incorrectly applied (as they so often are) lead to people breaking themselves down again and again under a bar, feeling beat up, pushing themselves so far deep into overtraining that the only light they see are the spots in front of their eyes after sets. </p>

<p>It depends on the lifter: some thrive under brutally repetitive and optimal programs, with high frequency and carefully tuned percentages that leave them forever hanging on the edge of their training ability, for others, a program like 5/3/1 provides the structure to get into the gym, and the opportunities to make it through bad days, and jack the weight up on good days. A program like 5/3/1 respects the lifter as a person, someone with a life outside of picking up things. </p>
