<p class="title">Cranium full of alphabet soup</p>    

<p>
Lots of rambling tonight. This is a freezer for ideas I might want to develop later. You’ve been warned. 
</p>

<p>
The past can be like a pair of shoelaces. It can get knotted and lightheadedly tight. You’ll want to keep someone in your life, so you’ll double or triple knot them in. Knot after knot. Like scar tissue that scaffolds wounds or that cheap plywood in Home Depot. Sometimes its for nothing. Sometimes you’re left with blisters. Get new laces. And learn to not tie so tight. 
</p>

<p>
Notebooks are great. Buy one. Carry one. Use one. It doesn’t matter what kind. Honestly my head has never felt clearer. Say what you will about the digital revolution– nothing will replace a paper notebook. 
</p>

<p>
Still really enjoying my habit book. As I delve more into the science behind the human clockwork, I can’t help but see how disruptive phones can be. This year Samsung launched a phone without Wi-Fi or data in South Korea. Tempting.

I was looking back through old notebooks and saw this. It was scribbled on a napkin and taped to a page. I remember writing it at Donut Crazy and watching the sun rise over Stratford. 
</p>

<p>
Don’t give up before you’ve started. People always rationalize themselves out of chasing something. “I’m too tall to be a gymnast” “I don’t have the right insertions to be a bodybuilder” “I don’t have the legs to be a runner” “I don’t have enough fast twitch muscle tissue to be a sprinter.” Honestly. The people who never find their gifts are the ones who never try. I see It everywhere in the gym. It’s as if the fear of failure is sedating chunks of the population. It’s better to fail. I’d know.
</p>

<p>
Instant gratification. I was thinking about Instant gratification. Humans are gratification driven animals. So much of modern society exists to prey on this facet of our humanity. Think financing, Spotify premium, steroids. These exist to fill a niche in the market for quick gratification, whether it’s the new car, the song, or engorged muscle tissue. 
</p>

<p>
I’ve mentioned it in the past, but I want to eventually write at length about motivation v. discipline. This is something so many people have a warped perception of. Anecdotally: 
motivation is what I get after a good cup of coffee, discipline is what gets me out the door.
