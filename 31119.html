      <h2>Mar 11</h2>
        <p>So here we are, the first real day off of spring break. I'm going to quote myself here, since exactky one year ago today I made my first post to this website.</p>

        <h3>Spring Break</h3>
<p>March 11th, 2018.</p>
<p>The world may be trying to kill me.<br>
Last week a real estate agent crashed into my car on the parkway, a backyard tree collapsed right where I had been standing, and I burned my mouth on a pizza topping. <br>
Some of these are more severe than others. </p>
<p>At least itâ€™s spring break, which will give me a chance to collect myself (and replace my missing passenger side mirror).<br>
I hate sitting around, so I am making this blog to keep myself busy and accountable over break.<br>
I have lots of plans for things that I want to get done: homework, hiking trips, gym sessions, car repairs, creative writing, video editing, reading, cooking, seeing friends, video games, and more. <br>            </p>
<p>Stay busy, stay happy. </p>

        <p>Something else interesting I did a year ago was join the 1000lbs club, a not-so exclusive group which I have probably left at this point. Anyway, I decided to reupload the celebratory video:</p>
        <iframe width="100%"; height=255px; src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2OENhbgAu4s" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>Beltless, in crunch fitness, and in the completely wrong type of shoe (the kind that damage your knees).</p>
        <p>But enough about the past. I have a bunch of plans for this break as well. More on that later. </p>
