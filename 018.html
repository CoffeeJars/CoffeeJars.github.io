<p class="title">summer’s doorstep</p>    
<p>
Finally, a straightforward post. 
</p>

<p>
The semester is drawing to a close. I don’t believe it. My first year of college nearly over.  I can’t say that I am happy with all of it; can’t say that I am proud of all of it, but I’m doing better. Much better than high school. 
</p>

<p>
I hate downtime. Fortunately, it seems my summer is going to be anything but relaxing.
</p>

<p>
I won’t be doing anything <i>too</i> crazy. Some college students go on road trips, or try to live an idealized French lifestyle, or get lost in a jungle, or try to piece high school friendships back together. As fun as these all might sound, I’m determined to improve myself this summer. 
</p>



<p>
Over my vacation I will be migrating to a static Jekyll site. This will remove the pain usually associated with updating my blog. Right now to write an entry I have to: create a new html page, type the post in plaintext, copy the post into the page and add formatting, edit index.html to include a link to the new post. This is ridiculous. It’s backwards even by my standards. <br>
Creating a Jekyll theme will keep me working on (and updating) this blog. 
</p>

<p>
I’ll also be working. Most likely in a state park! Thanks to my campus job I am technically a state employee, a state employee who is transferring to the department of environmental protection for a seasonal job. It’ll be my sixth job. I’ve gone from construction worker to dishwasher to bakery assistant to barista to teller to Math Emporium assistant. What a wild ride its been. 
</p>

<p>
Besides my department of environmental protection job this summer I have a couple other commitments lined up. I’ll be teaching kids about endangered shore birds. I’ll also probably be spending a week or so living in the Vermont woods, working on the Long Trail.
</p>

<p>
I’m longing for those sunny days when I can bike to the beach, go for a walk, read in the sun, take the train somewhere, just soak up the world.
</p>

<p>
On the fitness front I’ve got a steep summer ahead. When school ends I’ll be joining a real gym and begin some real training for my first powerlifting meet. I’m excited to leave crunch behind. I hate not being able to use chalk. I hate the soft pop music. I hate middle-aged women who bounce on ellipticals, like discount fruit, and wrinkle their noses on every deadlift eccentric. I hate high school kids who squat >100 lbs with backs like parabolas and scream on every rep. 
<br> <br>That felt good to get out. <br> <br>
 I’ll be dieting down to around 200lbs and shooting for a 1100lbs total! I’m a little nervous of course, but it should be a good experience. <br>
I also have to begin training for the CFA, the standardized test for admittance into the United States Naval Academy. Once my powerlifting meet is over I will dial back the compounds and get my feet under me a little more. When I took the NROTC AFA, I was able to hit 80+ push-ups, a 6-minute mile, and nearly 100 sit-ups. Back then I weighed 170lbs, the bodyweight movements will definitely be a lot harder carrying 30+ more lbs. Still confident though. 
</p>



<p>
The strenuous process of applying to a service academy is deserving of it’s own post, but over the summer I’ll be assembling the pieces of my Navy application. 
</p>


<p>
I was also selected to become a peer mentor for my university! I have to attend a couple summer training sessions but that will be a good experience and leadership position for the books. For those who don’t know, a peer mentor is a guide of sorts for the freshman class. They’re implanted into freshman classes and form the initially connection between freshman and college. I’m actually quite excited.
</p>

<p>
College students spend a third of their time procrastinating. Americans average four hours a day on their phones. Scared yet? I’ve been reading “How to break up with your phone” and it has been turning me into something of a technophobe. But really, look around and one out of every two people you see under 30 will have their face buried in a phone. I’ve been trying to appreciate life a little more. Live in the present. Be more productive. All those clichés. 
</p>

<p>
It is also high time that I got my finances in order. Which means budgeting. At the start of college, I created an excel spreadsheet with about 900 cells and percentages to break down hourly wages, it had a file size of about 6mb, and was a terrible way to budget. Simple and effective is the way to go. Think Pareto's principle. Start with income, subtract expenses, allocate the rest. I’m aiming to build up my emergency fund again, put more into my IRA, get myself into a good place for college in the fall.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I will be prepping for my SAT, my third SAT. I have the second one in a week to set a benchmark, and will be prepping like mad after that. I’m aiming high, 1400-1500 at least.
</p>

<p>
What a wild summer it is going to be.
