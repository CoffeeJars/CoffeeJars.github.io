<p class="title">hook grip</p>    


<p>
I never imagined I would ever be concerned with the minutiae of barbell grips. <br> 
I’ve been acclimating myself to the thumb-wrenching hook grip. 
</p>

<p>
It is absolutely beautiful out today. I laid in the grass and studied history. It was the most peaceful I’ve felt in a long time. 
</p>

<p>
My afternoon consists of homework in a swanky coffee bar and the daily gym penance.
