<h2>Rice & Web Design</h2>
    <h3>Web Design</h3>
<p> I’ve had this website, stephlog, for eight months, and changed its appearance more times than I can count. Here are some of the better designed websites I’ve made. </p>
<h3> Stephen’s Notebook </h3>
<img class="rice" src="https://i.imgur.com/r8MZXmH.png"> 
<p> This was the index.html of my first site! It has some really nice colors, but terrible padding and alignment. I didn’t understand much about CSS. </p>
<img class="rice" src="https://i.imgur.com/ZsNwbyU.png">
<p> My first site was quite simple. It consisted of three pages. A home page, an about page, and this: the blog. The blog followed the same design as the home page, colorful background with white iceberg text boxes. My original blogging style was stream of consciousness rambling, nothing very interesting. </p>
<img class="rice" src="https://i.imgur.com/WNZT6Fj.png"> 
<p> The about me page. Funny now because of how dated it is, wrong major, wrong workout program, wrong lifts, at least my email address is right. </p>
<h3> StephHep</h3>
<img class="rice" src="https://i.imgur.com/OrOsqV4.png"> 
<p> StephHep was the name of a very dumb workout routine that I made. Despite the idiocy that was the program, I thought the site came out really nicely. A centered column of text which incorporated colors from the Van Gogh background. This is also the first example of me using sans-serif headers and serif body text, a style choice I still use!  </p>

<h3> Bookish</h3>
<img class="rice" src="https://i.imgur.com/ZGTj10N.png"> 
<p> I called this design bookish, I opted for a non-white background for easy reading and adopted an old style font, I paired this with a 100 weight roboto to use as a permanent header for navigation.   </p>
<img class="rice" src="https://i.imgur.com/aSUvycJ.png"> 
<p> Besides the list of blog entries I only ever completed the styling for the posts themselves. That’s how it was most of the time, before I had even finished one design I would be already moving onto the next concept. Of all the designs I’ve made, with the exception of my current theme, I think bookish is my favorite in it’s presentation of text. </p>

<h3> Blogger-lite</h3>
<img class="rice" src="https://i.imgur.com/WWJvlwr.png"> 
<p> My next design worth mentioning was blogger-lite. I wanted to recreate the presentation of a more traditional blog, stripped down. If it hasn’t been apparent yet, I love web minimalism. There’s nothing I hate more than pop-ups and auto playing videos and ads. This design utilized a floating right hand column to provide links to specific parts of the post (displayed left). I used a slight blue hue for the background and on the sub headers. </p>
<img class="rice" src="https://i.imgur.com/QcaTJ9B.png"> 
<p>This is what the home page looked like. Very simple. List of posts and a quick tag line. </p>

    
<h3> Paragraph</h3>
<img class="rice" src="https://i.imgur.com/o7s7yxu.png"> 
<p> I changed the homepage of my site to be this. A paragraph wrapped around a site name. Certain lines in the paragraph were links to blog posts. The paragraph is a purple prose rendition of my life from high school up through college so far. </p>

<h3> Mantra</h3>
<img class="rice" src=" https://i.imgur.com/2ysLQZu.png"> 
<p> I wasn’t happy with the paragraph, so I took my site down for maintenance and put this up as a place holder. I was looking for an excuse to use these colors and this font. You may recognize that this is just the paragraph from the previous iteration- just restyled.  </p>


<h3> rxbar</h3>
<img class="rice" src="https://i.imgur.com/pTR5qs5.png"> 
<p> I was in a gas station one day looking for a snack before a gym session and I saw an rxbar. I was struck with inspiration. This site was the result of that inspiration. I love the colors and the block-underline power that the text has.  </p>

<h3> Calorie</h3>
<img class="rice" src="https://i.imgur.com/7POGd0N.png"> 
<p> I love food. I was working at my summer job for the state of Connecticut and I saw the nutrition facts on a seltzer can, and was once again struck with inspiration. This was the result. Note the varying rule of the lines, and the text alignment.  </p>



    <h3>Rice</h3>
    <p>’Ricing’ is the process of customizing a computer’s visuals to be (hopefully) aesthetically appealing. As I was cleaning out old files, I came upon a folder full of old screenshots. Note the various hostnames and kernel version numbers. </p>

    <h3> Dark and Ugly</h3>
<img class="rice" src="https://i.imgur.com/IEI9hPT.png">
<p>On the left hand side is web browser, open to HPMOR.  The right has three terminals: screenfetch, dict (a dictionary program), and a colorscript. As you can see from the screenfetch, this is a very old screenshot, I’m running debian Jessie on kernel 3.16. The colors look dreadful too, dark and muddy. I was using the barebones SWM for window management. <p>
    <h3>Bright, Still Ugly</h3>
<img class="rice" src="https://i.imgur.com/tGkxOQ7.png">
<img class="rice" src="https://i.imgur.com/UCQhmXc.png">
<p>Well, it got more colorful at least. The background is a horrible vivid green, but the terminal colors seem to have improved. I’ve moved on to FrankenWM, which I will stick with until 2018. Using the options available in FrankenWM, I put thick borders around the terminals. I also took great steps forward in web browsing. In the second screenshot, you can see an edited Firefox window on the left. I also began to play with Emacs around this time. You can even see Atto, a minimalist emacs-like editor. Acute observers might note that I am now on Debian 8.2 in this screenshot, and that I have changed shells. </p>
<h3>Harold and the Purple Crayon </h3>
<img class="rice" src="https://i.imgur.com/NeRBUZ2.png">
<img class="rice" src="https://i.imgur.com/OqdIKn5.png">
<p>I remember that the purple colorscheme seen here was originally a mistake, the result of some mistyped HEX codes. Turns out, I liked it, and kept it. What I like about these screenshots is that they show me beginning to live inside the linux environment. I’m playing nethack in the first photo, and using mutt to manage my email. I have also begun to get used to HTML/CSS, as you can see from my customized startpage on the left hand side of the first screenshot. </p>
<h3>Big Blue</h3>
<img class="rice" src="https://i.imgur.com/4UMAkQh.png">
<img class="rice" src="https://i.imgur.com/bfEcQtm.png">
<p> My final two screenshots from my days using Frankenwm. I’m on kernel 4.9, and running debian stretch. I have a new startpage, thinned the window borders, and returned to more normal low-contrast colors.  </p>
