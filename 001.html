<p class="title">Spring Break</p>    
    
        <p>The world may be trying to kill me.<br>
            Last week a real estate agent crashed into my car on the parkway, a backyard tree collapsed right where I had been standing, and I burned my mouth on a pizza topping. <br>
            Some of these are more severe than others. </p>

            <p>At least itâ€™s spring break, which will give me a chance to collect myself (and replace my missing passenger side mirror).<br>
            I hate sitting around, so I am making this blog to keep myself busy and accountable over break.<br>
            I have lots of plans for things that I want to get done: homework, hiking trips, gym sessions, car repairs, creative writing, video editing, reading, cooking, seeing friends, video games, and more. <br>
            </p>
<p>Stay busy, stay happy. </p>
