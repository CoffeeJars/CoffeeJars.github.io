        <h1>Pascal's Triangle in Python</h1> 
        <p class="cap">June 18th, 2019.</p>

            <p>I've started easing myself back into programming regularly.</p>

            <p>I decided to tackle another project Euler question, #15. Turns out I have no knowledge whatsoever on combinatorics. Yikes. After a quick wikipedia skim I stumbled upon a picture of Pascal's triangle, and realized that the number of unique lattice paths seemed to fall along a medial line. While I might not exactly understand <i>why</i> this is the case, I quickly wrote a python script to output Pascal's triangle. </p>

            <p>If we define the top of the triangle as the 0th level, it follows that the the number of unique lattice paths for a grid of n by n size will be the central number on the n*2 level of Pascal's triangle. </p> 

            <p>It leaves a bad taste in my mouth to get the right answer but to not understand the mechanics of how this works, It's something I am going to have to investigate. </p>

            <p>For those curious, here's the code:</p>
