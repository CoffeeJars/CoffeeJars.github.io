<p class="title">wonton soup</p>    
    
<p> Another post filled with scattered thoughts. <br>
I am sipping from a mug of wonton soup as I type this. I always order it from the same Chinese restaurant. I feel as though someone has staged a coup and restructured the place. They never used to give plastic takeout containers, only metal. Their wonton soup stock used to have more scallions and was less colloidal. Worse still, the nice hostess with the shallow-water eyes seems to have been fired. <br>
I can only hope that she has received a large inheritance or has started a new life as a coal baron or perhaps is now the captain of a fishing trawler in the South China Sea. </p>

<p> I worked out today. <br>
Still need to stretch & run. <br>
At least I am finishing my nsuns workouts. <br>
Something that I noticed today was that changing my grip while doing barbell curls made them more comfortable. Normally, the <del>external rotation</del> radial deviation from the straight bar puts a strain on my forearm, but when I switched to a ‘false grip’ it felt a lot better! <br>
From now on I will be sticking with hammer and barbell curls for bicep work. </p>

<p> There are days when I hate my Macbook Pro, and today was one of them. <br>
I needed to install a third party program off github (that was in alpha!) to be able to control the audio levels for various applications. This <b>simple</b> functionality is completely missing from OSX. It really boils my blood that people pay top dollar for these slick, apple embossed, steel brushed laptops; only to find that if they are locked into controlling one big master volume dial. </p>

<p> I made another video today. <br>
Link is <a href=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KfmxuwU-u4&list=LLn_AIk8YHs6s-QbktQh_XCQ&index=1”>here</a>! I was inspired by my favorite anime, Neon Genesis Evangelion, to create a mix of songs that reflect the somber outlook of Shinji Ikari. It’s an excellent mix to study to. <br>
I am trying really hard to make a couple videos before my 30-day trial of final cut pro runs out. <br>
Lord knows I can’t afford it. </p>


<p>What are blogs if not random musings?</p>
