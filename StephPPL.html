<p class="title">Stephen's PPL</p> 

<p>
 'Stephen's PPL' is the distillation of the 6-day push/pull/legs training style with inspiration from classic strongman Doug Hepburn. This program aims to build up my weak points, provide a fresh way for me to progress, maintain familiarity with the compound lifts, and work in a variety of rep ranges. The Hepburn style of progression will also help me maintain strength while cutting weight.
</p>

<p>
<b>Beginners:</b> this is not the routine for you. Research Ivysaurâ€™s 4-4-8 or Phranks's Greyskull LP variant. Both are better choices for you. The slower progression of this program is better suited to intermediate lifters. If you want to use this program keep in mind that the accessory movements are tailored towards my goals. They can be changed to better suit your needs.
</p>

<p>
Use 80% of your 1RM for the heavy lifts. <br>
Heavy lifts are done 8x2-3 <br>
Use 60% of your 1RM for the volume lifts. <br>
Volume lifts are done 4x6-8 <br>
Tertiary lifts are done 4x10 (4x20 calf raises) <br>
90-120 seconds of rest between sets. <br>
Lifts are alternated. Ex: Deadlift heavy and volume row on Monday, row heavy and volume deadlift on Thursday.

<p class="title"> Progression </p>

<p> Progression is very simple. After every successful workout add a rep to the end of each exercise. </p>

<p>Imagine you complete all deadlift reps on Monday (2/2/2/2/2/2/2/2), next deadlift session you will pull (2/2/2/2/2/2/2/3), and the session after that (2/2/2/2/2/2/3/3), and the following session (2/2/2/2/2/3/3/3). </p>

<p> This will continue until you complete 8x3. When you complete 8x3 you add 10lbs to the bar and start over at 8x2. </p>

<p> It may feel slow. It may not seem like much. But over the course of a year you will add 120lbs to every lift. </p>
    
<p> The Volume lifts progress from (6/6/6) to (6/6/7) and upon reaching (8/8/8) weight is added. </p>

<p> I find that sometimes adding additional reps helps keep the workouts challenging. Find what works for you. </p>
