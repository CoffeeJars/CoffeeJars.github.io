<p> Thank god.<br>My political science midterm was moved to Friday. </p>

<p> School closes at 12 today– means I escape the clutches of my evening shift. <br>
Busy day. I’ve been working on a new fitness routine to replace nsunsLP. I also have a few essays to sand down. </p>

<p> This site’s markup looks like impressionist finger painting from a toddler’s fever dream. I should probably clean it up. Make a separate css file. Try and stick to a format. <br>But how can I do that if I can't even bother to write complete sentences for these posts?
    
<p> In good news my back is feeling much better. Looks like I just ripped up my rhomboids, serratus anterior, traps, etc etc.</p>

<p> Too busy to write much. </p>
