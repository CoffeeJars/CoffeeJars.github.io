       <h2>A Short History of Rice</h2>
    <p>’Ricing’ is the process of customizing a computer’s visuals to be (hopefully) aesthetically appealing. As I was cleaning out old files, I came upon a folder full of old screenshots. Note the various hostnames and kernel version numbers. </p>

    <h3> Dark and Ugly</h3>

<p>On the left hand side is web browser, open to HPMOR.  The right has three terminals: screenfetch, dict (a dictionary program), and a colorscript. As you can see from the screenfetch, this is a very old screenshot, I’m running debian Jessie on kernel 3.16. The colors look dreadful too, dark and muddy. I was using the barebones SWM for window management. <p>
    <h3>Bright, Still Ugly</h3>

<p>Well, it got more colorful at least. The background is a horrible vivid green, but the terminal colors seem to have improved. I’ve moved on to FrankenWM, which I will stick with until 2018. Using the options available in FrankenWM, I put thick borders around the terminals. I also took great steps forward in web browsing. In the second screenshot, you can see an edited Firefox window on the left. I also began to play with Emacs around this time. You can even see Atto, a minimalist emacs-like editor. Acute observers might note that I am now on Debian 8.2 in this screenshot, and that I have changed shells. </p>
<h3>Harold and the Purple Crayon </h3>

<p>I remember that the purple colorscheme seen here was originally a mistake, the result of some mistyped HEX codes. Turns out, I liked it, and kept it. What I like about these screenshots is that they show me beginning to live inside the linux environment. I’m playing nethack in the first photo, and using mutt to manage my email. I have also begun to get used to HTML/CSS, as you can see from my customized startpage on the left hand side of the first screenshot. </p>
<h3>Big Blue</h3>

<p> My final two screenshots from my days using Frankenwm. I’m on kernel 4.9, and running debian stretch. I have a new startpage, thinned the window borders, and returned to more normal low-contrast colors.  </p>
