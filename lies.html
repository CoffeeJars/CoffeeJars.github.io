                <h2>Had my jaw on the floor</h2>
                <p>April 5th, 2019</p>
                <p>Eye opening. I received a perfect score on my AP United States History exam, yet this book made me feel as though I knew nothing, less than nothing.</p>
                <p>Shallow critics might complain that this book has a political slant. Well yes, it does. One of Loewen's core arguments is that history is inherently partial, that it needs to be examined as such, that 'apolitical' history is anything but, and that an uncontroversial 'feel good' history is dangerous to our democracy, and democracy everywhere.</p>
                <p>Slow at times.</p>
