<p class="title">scapula blues</p>    
<p> I think I overdid It with the barbell rows. </p>
<p> I’ve been in excruciating pain recently. I think I ripped the muscles of my upper back, possibly the connective tissue. <br>
Puffing my chest out hurts. Breathing hurts. Retracting my scapula hurts. Sitting hurts. Laying down hurts. <br>
<br>It’s the wakeup call I needed. <br>
Since I started working out I’ve carelessly neglected stretching or warming up. <br>
I’ve started. For the past two days I have followed the <a href=”https://phrakture.github.io/starting-stretching.html”>Starting Stretching</a> routine and It’s been great! Hopefully it’s just not too late for me and my incredibly tight hamstrings and hip flexors. </p>

<p>I think I will be making a before/after video to show the difference that a month of stretching makes. </p>

<p>I hate this constant pain. It is so hard to focus on my stack of homework while I’m aching, while I can’t sit up, while I can’t sleep. </p>

<p>I will be switching from the nsunsLP routine to a PPL. Taking Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday off and then starting on Thursday. Or maybe a different program? Hepburn inspired routines seem cool as well. It’s something I need to put thought into. </p>
    
<p> I want to try out the zercher squat and the steinborn squat!</p>
    
<p> I also want to replay a couple video games from my youth. </p>
    
    <p> So much to do. So little time.</p>

<p> More than a foot of snow en route to bury CT again. </p>
