cool emacs thing: using eshell and using the arrows to return to old
commands, then going into god mode and moving around the term to copy
standard out. then opening up a buffer and saving that text. And then
pressing g q to resize the long line into nice formatted text. and
then pressing C-h c and hitting M-q and being informed that it is
(fill-paragraph). And then entering (god-mode) and hitting x e to
actually fill in the paragraph which we just filled.
