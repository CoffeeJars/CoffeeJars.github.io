  <h2>General Chemistry fun with Python</h2>
  <!--
      <p>Here is a list of posts/things I want to write about in no particular order. Linux from scratch (Perhaps for my minimal text-based TTY setup). Also speaking of, write about setting up a minimal chromebook c720. Write about taking back your time, (the great time tracking experiment) breaking up with the phone, changing habits, all of that fun stuff. </p>
    <p>Write also about goals and future plans. something something about prust and that philisopher wittenstein, and unfuck yourself and the power of words and how people who write down their goals usually achieve them more often then those who dont. Also project Euler, fitness update, focusing on one thing, probably aestetics? Emacs and emacs customization stuff. </p>
    <p>Also I want to write about those other projects, eveventually the make a lisp guide to learn some C. (maybe over the summer?) I can also do some gameboy hacking then. Also I want to talk about LaTeX, my notetaking plans and what utensils I like (the glorius g2 pen, my mechanical pencil, saving for my mechanical keyboard,etc</p>
    <p>Emacs customization stuff would include my own theme to suit my needs for programming/LaTeX/Org mode/HTML/etc. I want a minimal theme, just black text on a white background with minimal other distractions. I also want to really learn some better hotkeys and boost that productivity. Speaking of productivity, and unrelated to emacs, I want to learn git (start using magit?) I also might want to use eshell, and learn a little emacs lisp. Also use IBM plex as the font.</p>
