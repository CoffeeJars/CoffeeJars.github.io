<p class="title">changing tracks</p>    


<p>
I survived finals week. Usually when people say that they <i>survived</i> something, it’s followed by a laugh, I’m not laughing. I lost 10 pounds. I went from a <del>robust</del> porky 215 to a linguine 203. </p>

<p> 
I realize that a lot of my recent posts, if you can call them that, have dealt with my never-ending and borderline obsessive quest for physical fitness. To keep things fresh, I’m going to mix things up a little today and talk about some other things that I have been up to.  
</p> 

<p>
I’ve been cooking!<br> I particularly like breakfast foods, waffles, pancakes, bacon, ham, eggs, even toast. A cup of coffee on the side to keep my caffeine habit in check and I have the makings of a great morning. 
</p>

<p>
Today for example I made a delicious breakfast sandwich. <br>
<p class="rec">
    Stephen's HEC
<br>    In a cast iron pan with medium-low heat.
<br>fry:
<br>two (2) eggs
<br>three (3) slices of ham
<br>chopped red pepper
<br>chopped onions
<br>
<br>Optionally you can add 2 strips of bacon or 1 sausage patty for some additional protein and flavor. 
<br><br>Make sure not to overcook the eggs, season with salt and pepper after you flip them, and add a slice of American cheese to each egg. 
<br><br> It’s delicious on Portuguese rolls, hard rolls, or a toasted bagel.
